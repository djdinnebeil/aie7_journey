Some of it will travel well\\nto other regions and countries, some probably will not. Caveat\\nemptor.\\nWith all that out of the way, let\u2019s start at the beginning: why not\\nto do a startup.\\nStartups, even in the wake of the crash of 2000, have become\\nimbued with a real mystique \u2014 you read a lot about how great\\nit is to do a startup, how much fun it is, what with the getting to\\ninvent the future, all the free meals, foosball tables, and all the\\nrest.\\nNow, it is true that there are a lot of great things about doing a\\nstartup. They include, in my experience:\\nMost fundamentally, the opportunity to be in control of your own\\ndestiny \u2014 you get to succeed or fail on your own, and you don\u2019t\\nhave some bozo telling you what to do. For a certain kind of personality, this alone is reason enough to do a startup.\\nThe opportunity to create something new \u2014 the proverbial blank\\nsheet of paper. You have the ability \u2014 actually, the obligation\\n\u2014 to imagine a product that does not yet exist and bring it\\ninto existence, without any of the constraints normally faced by\\nlarger companies.\\nThe opportunity to have an impact on the world \u2014 to give people\\na new way to communicate, a new way to share information, a\\nnew way to work together, or anything else you can think of that\\nwould make the world a better place. Think it should be easier\\nfor low-income people to borrow money? Start Prosper. Think\\ntelevision should be opened up to an inXnite number of channels? Start Joost. Think that computers should be based on Unix\\nand open standards and not proprietary technology? Start Sun.\\nThe ability to create your ideal culture and work with a dream team\\nof people you get to assemble yourself. Want your culture to be\\nbased on people who have fun every day and enjoy working\\ntogether? Or, are hyper-competitive both in work and play? Or,\\nare super-focused on creating innovative new rocket science\\nPart 1: Why not to do a startup 3\\ntechnologies? Or, are global in perspective from day one? You\\nget to choose, and to build your culture and team to suit.\\nAnd Xnally, money \u2014 startups done right can of course be highly\\nlucrative. This is not just an issue of personal greed \u2014 when\\nthings go right, your team and employees will themselves do\\nvery well and will be able to support their families, send their\\nkids to college, and realize their dreams, and that\u2019s really cool.\\nAnd if you\u2019re really lucky, you as the entrepreneur can ultimately make profound philanthropic gias that change society\\nfor the better.\\nHowever, there are many more reasons to not do a startup.\\nFirst, and most importantly, realize that a startup puts you on\\nan emotional rollercoaster unlike anything you have ever experienced.\\nYou will Yip rapidly from a day in which you are euphorically\\nconvinced you are going to own the world, to a day in which\\ndoom seems only weeks away and you feel completely ruined,\\nand back again.\\nOver and over and over.\\nAnd I\u2019m talking about what happens to stable entrepreneurs.\\nThere is so much uncertainty and so much risk around practically everything you are doing. Will the product ship on time?\\nWill it be fast enough? Will it have too many bugs? Will it be\\neasy to use? Will anyone use it? Will your competitor beat you\\nto market? Will you get any press coverage? Will anyone invest\\nin the company? Will that key new engineer join? Will your key\\nuser interface designer quit and go to Google? And on and on\\nand on\u2026\\nSome days things will go really well and some things will go\\nreally poorly. And the level of stress that you\u2019re under generally\\nwill magnify those transient data points into incredible highs\\nand unbelievable lows at whiplash speed and huge magnitude.\\nSound like fun?\\n4 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nSecond, in a startup, absolutely nothing happens unless you make it\\nhappen.\\nThis one throws both founders and employees new to startups.\\nIn an established company \u2014 no matter how poorly run or\\ndemoralized \u2014 things happen. They just happen. People come\\nin to work. Code gets written. User interfaces get designed.\\nServers get provisioned. Markets get analyzed. Pricing gets studied and determined. Sales calls get made. The wastebaskets get\\nemptied. And so on.\\nA startup has none of the established systems, rhythms, infrastructure that any established company has.\\nIn a startup it is very easy for the code to not get written, for the\\nuser interfaces to not get designed\u2026 for people to not come into\\nwork\u2026 and for the wastebaskets to not get emptied.\\nYou as the founder have to put all of these systems and routines\\nand habits in place and get everyone actually rowing \u2014 forget\\neven about rowing in the right direction: just rowing at all is\\nhard enough at the start.\\nAnd until you do, absolutely nothing happens.\\nUnless, of course, you do it yourself.\\nHave fun emptying those wastebaskets.\\nThird, you get told no \u2014 a lot.\\nUnless you\u2019ve spent time in sales, you are probably not familiar\\nwith being told no a lot.\\nIt\u2019s not so much fun.\\nGo watch Death of a Salesman and then Glengarry Glen Ross.\\nThat\u2019s roughly what it\u2019s like.\\nYou\u2019re going to get told no by potential employees, potential\\ninvestors, potential customers, potential partners, reporters,\\nanalysts\u2026\\nPart 1: Why not to do a startup 5\\nOver and over and over.\\nAnd when you do get a \u201cyes\u201d, half the time you\u2019ll get a call two\\ndays later and it\u2019ll turn out the answer has morphed into \u201cno\u201d.\\nBetter start working on your fake smile.\\nFourth, hiring is a huge pain in the ass.\\nYou will be amazed how many windowshoppers you\u2019ll deal with.\\nA lot of people think they want to be part of a startup, but when\\nthe time comes to leave their cushy job at HP or Apple, they\\nYinch \u2014 and stay.\\nGoing through the recruiting process and being seduced by a\\nstartup is heady stuW for your typical engineer or midlevel manager at a big company \u2014 you get to participate vicariously in the\\nthrill of a startup without actually having to join or do any of the\\nhard work.\\nAs a founder of a startup trying to hire your team, you\u2019ll run into\\nthis again and again.\\nWhen Jim Clark decided to start a new company in 1994, I was\\none of about a dozen people at various Silicon Valley companies\\nhe was talking to about joining him in what became Netscape.\\nI was the only one who went all the way to saying \u201cyes\u201d (largely\\nbecause I was 22 and had no reason not to do it).\\nThe rest Yinched and didn\u2019t do it.\\nAnd this was Jim Clark, a legend in the industry who was coming\\noW of the most successful company in Silicon Valley in 1994 \u2014\\nSilicon Graphics Inc.\\nHow easy do you think it\u2019s going to be for you?\\nThen, once you do get through the windowshoppers and actually hire some people, your success rate on hiring is probably\\nnot going to be higher than 50%, and that\u2019s if you\u2019re good at it.\\nBy that I mean that half or more of the people you hire aren\u2019t\\n6 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\ngoing to work out. They\u2019re going to be too lazy, too slow, easily\\nrattled, political, bipolar, or psychotic.\\nAnd then you have to either live with them, or Xre them.\\nWhich ones of those sounds like fun?\\nFiah, God help you, at some point you\u2019re going to have to hire executives.\\nYou think hiring employees is hard and risky \u2014 wait until you\\nstart hiring for VP Engineering, VP Marketing, VP Sales, VP HR,\\nGeneral Counsel, and CFO.\\nSixth, the hours.\\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk in Silicon Valley lately about work/life\\nbalance \u2014 about how you should be able to do a startup and\\nsimultaneously live a full and fulXlling outside life.\\nNow, personally, I have a lot of sympathy for that point of view.\\nAnd I try hard in my companies (well, at least my last two companies) to do whatever I can to help make sure that people aren\u2019t\\nground down to little tiny spots on the Yoor by the workload\\nand the hours.\\nBut, it\u2019s really diZcult.\\nThe fact is that startups are incredibly intense experiences and\\ntake a lot out of people in the best of circumstances.\\nAnd just because you want people to have work/life balance, it\u2019s\\nnot so easy when you\u2019re close to running out of cash, your product hasn\u2019t shipped yet, your VC is mad at you, and your Kleiner\\nPerkins-backed competitor in Menlo Park \u2014 you know, the one\\nwhose employees\u2019 average age seems to be about 19 \u2014 is kicking\\nyour butt.\\nWhich is what it\u2019s going to be like most of the time.\\nAnd even if you can help your employees have proper work/life\\nbalance, as a founder you certainly won\u2019t.\\nPart 1: Why not to do a startup 7\\n(In case you were wondering, by the way, the hours do compound the stress.)\\nSeventh, it\u2019s really easy for the culture of a startup to go sideways.\\nThis combines the Xrst and second items above.\\nThis is the emotional rollercoaster wreaking havoc on not just\\nyou but your whole company.\\nIt takes time for the culture of any company to become \u201cset\u201d \u2014\\nfor the team of people who have come together for the Xrst time\\nto decide collectively what they\u2019re all about, what they value \u2014\\nand how they look at challenge and adversity.\\nIn the best case, you get an amazing dynamic of people really\\npulling together, supporting one another, and working their collective tails oW in pursuit of a dream.\\nIn the worst case, you end up with widespread, self-reinforcing\\nbitterness, disillusionment, cynicism, bad morale, contempt for\\nmanagement, and depression.\\nAnd you as the founder have much less inYuence over this than\\nyou\u2019ll think you do.\\nGuess which way it usually goes.\\nEighth, there are lots of X factors that can come along and whup\\nyou right upside the head, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing you\\ncan do about them.\\nStock market crashes.\\nTerrorist attacks.\\nNatural disasters.\\nA better funded startup with a more experienced team that\u2019s\\nbeen hard at work longer than you have, in stealth mode, that\\nunexpectedly releases a product that swialy comes to dominate\\nyour market, completely closing oW your opportunity, and you\\nhad no idea they were even working on it.\\n8 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nAt best, any given X factor might slam shut the fundraising\\nwindow, cause customers to delay or cancel purchases \u2014 or, at\\nworst, shut down your whole company.\\nRussian mobsters laundering millions of dollars of dirty money\\nthrough your service, resulting in the credit card companies\\nclosing you down.\\nYou think I\u2019m joking about that one?\\nOK, now here\u2019s the best part:\\nI haven\u2019t even talked about Xguring out what product to build,\\nbuilding it, taking it to market, and standing out from the crowd.\\nAll the risks in the core activities of what your company actually\\ndoes are yet to come, and to be discussed in future posts in this\\nseries.\\nPart 1: Why not to do a startup 9\\nPart 2: When the VCs say \"no\"\\nThis post is about what to do between when the VCs say \u201cno\u201d to\\nfunding your startup, and when you either change their minds\\nor Xnd some other path.\\nI\u2019m going to assume that you\u2019ve done all the basics: developed a\\nplan and a pitch, decided that venture Xnancing is right for you\\nand you are right for venture Xnancing, lined up meetings with\\nproperly qualiXed VCs, and made your pitch.\\nAnd the answer has come back and it\u2019s \u201cno\u201d.\\nOne \u201cno\u201d doesn\u2019t mean anything \u2014 the VC could just be having\\na bad day, or she had a bad experience with another company in\\nyour category, or she had a bad experience with another company with a similar name, or she had a bad experience with\\nanother founder who kind of looks like you, or her Mercedes\\nSLR McLaren\u2019s engine could have blown up on the freeway that\\nmorning \u2014 it could be anything. Go meet with more VCs.\\nIf you meet with three VCs and they all say \u201cno\u201d, it could just be\\na big coincidence. Go meet with more VCs.\\nIf you meet with Xve, or six, or eight VCs and they all say no, it\u2019s\\nnot a coincidence.\\nThere is something wrong with your plan.\\nOr, even if there isn\u2019t, there might as well be, because you\u2019re still\\nnot getting funded.\\nMeeting with more VCs aaer a bunch have said no is probably\\na waste of time. Instead, retool your plan \u2014 which is what this\\npost is about.\\nBut Hrst, lay the groundwork to go back in later.\\nIt\u2019s an old \u2014 and true \u2014 cliche that VCs rarely actually say \u201cno\u201d\\n\u2014 more oaen they say \u201cmaybe\u201d, or \u201cnot right now\u201d, or \u201cmy partners aren\u2019t sure\u201d, or \u201cthat\u2019s interesting, let me think about it\u201d.\\nThey do that because they don\u2019t want to invest in your company\\ngiven the current facts, but they want to keep the door open in\\ncase the facts change.\\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what you want \u2014 you want to be able to go\\nback to them with a new set of facts, and change their minds,\\nand get to \u201cyes\u201d.\\nSo be sure to take \u201cno\u201d gracefully \u2014 politely ask them for feedback (which they probably won\u2019t give you, at least not completely honestly \u2014 nobody likes calling someone else\u2019s baby\\nugly \u2014 believe me, I\u2019ve done it), thank them for their time, and\\nask if you can call them again if things change.\\nTrust me \u2014 they\u2019d much rather be saying \u201cyes\u201d than \u201cno\u201d \u2014\\nthey need all the good investments they can get.\\nSecond, consider the environment.\\nBeing told \u201cno\u201d by VCs in 1999 is a lot diWerent than being told\\n\u201cno\u201d in 2002.\\nIf you were told \u201cno\u201d in 1999, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a wonderful person and you have huge potential and your mother loves you\\nvery much, but your plan really was seriously Yawed.\\nIf you were told \u201cno\u201d in 2002, you probably actually were the\\nnext Google, but most of the VCs were hiding under their desks\\nand they just missed it.\\nIn my opinion, we\u2019re now in a much more rational environment\\nthan either of those extremes \u2014 a lot of good plans are being\\nfunded, along with some bad ones, but not all the bad ones.\\nPart 2: When the VCs say \"no\" 11\\nI\u2019ll proceed under the assumption that we\u2019re in normal times.\\nBut if things get truly euphoric or truly funereal again, the rest\\nof this post will probably not be very helpful \u2014 in either case.\\nThird, retool your plan.\\nThis is the hard part \u2014 changing the facts of your plan and what\\nyou are trying to do, to make your company more fundable.\\nTo describe the dimensions that you should consider as you\\ncontemplate retooling your plan, let me introduce the onion\\ntheory of risk.\\nIf you\u2019re an investor, you look at the risk around an investment\\nas if it\u2019s an onion. Just like you peel an onion and remove each\\nlayer in turn, risk in a startup investment comes in layers that\\nget peeled away \u2014 reduced \u2014 one by one.\\nYour challenge as an entrepreneur trying to raise venture capital\\nis to keep peeling layers of risk oW of your particular onion until\\nthe VCs say \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 until the risk in your startup is reduced to\\nthe point where investing in your startup doesn\u2019t look terrifying\\nand merely looks risky.\\nWhat are the layers of risk for a high-tech\\nstartup?\\nIt depends on the startup, but here are some of the common\\nones:\\nFounder risk \u2014 does the startup have the right founding team?\\nA common founding team might include a great technologist,\\nplus someone who can run the company, at least to start. Is the\\ntechnologist really all that? Is the business person capable of\\nrunning the company? Is the business person missing from the\\nteam altogether? Is it a business person or business people with\\nno technologist, and therefore virtually unfundable?\\nMarket risk \u2014 is there a market for the product (using the term\\nproduct and service interchangeably)? Will anyone want it? Will\\nthey pay for it? How much will they pay? How do we know?\\n12 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nCompetition risk \u2014 are there too many other startups already\\ndoing this? Is this startup suZciently diWerentiated from the\\nother startups, and also diWerentiated from any large incumbents?\\nTiming risk \u2014 is it too early? Is it too late?\\nFinancing risk \u2014 aaer we invest in this round, how many additional rounds of Xnancing will be required for the company to\\nbecome proXtable, and what will the dollar total be? How certain\\nare we about these estimates? How do we know?\\nMarketing risk \u2014 will this startup be able to cut through the\\nnoise? How much will marketing cost? Do the economics of customer acquisition \u2014 the cost to acquire a customer, and the revenue that customer will generate \u2014 work?\\nDistribution risk \u2014 does this startup need certain distribution\\npartners to succeed? Will it be able to get them? How? (For\\nexample, this is a common problem with mobile startups that\\nneed deals with major mobile carriers to succeed.)\\nTechnology risk \u2014 can the product be built? Does it involve rocket\\nscience \u2014 or an equivalent, like artiXcial intelligence or natural\\nlanguage processing? Are there fundamental breakthroughs that\\nneed to happen? If so, how certain are we that they will happen,\\nor that this team will be able to make them?\\nProduct risk \u2014 even assuming the product can in theory be built,\\ncan this team build it?\\nHiring risk \u2014 what positions does the startup need to hire for in\\norder to execute its plan? E.g. a startup planning to build a highscale web service will need a VP of Operations \u2014 will the founding team be able to hire a good one?\\nLocation risk \u2014 where is the startup located? Can it hire the right\\ntalent in that location? And will I as the VC need to drive more\\nthan 20 minutes in my Mercedes SLR McLaren to get there?\\nYou know, when you stack up all these layers and look at the\\nPart 2: When the VCs say \"no\" 13\\nfull onion, you realize it\u2019s amazing that any venture investments\\never get made.\\nWhat you need to do is take a hard-headed look at each of these\\nrisks \u2014 and any others that are speciXc to your startup and its\\ncategory \u2014 and put yourself in the VC\u2019s shoes: what could this\\nstartup do to minimize or eliminate enough of these risks to\\nmake the company fundable?\\nThen do those things.\\nThis isn\u2019t very much fun, since it will probably involve making\\nsigniXcant changes to your plan, but look on the bright side: it\u2019s\\nexcellent practice for when your company ultimately goes public and has to Xle an S1 registration statement with the SEC, in\\nwhich you have to itemize in huge detail every conceivable risk\\nand bad thing that could ever possibly happen to you, up to and\\nincluding global warming.\\nSome ideas on reducing risk\\nFounder risk \u2014 the tough one. If you\u2019re the technologist on a\\nfounding team with a business person, you have to consider the\\npossibility that the VCs don\u2019t think the business person is strong\\nenough to be the founding CEO. Or vice versa, maybe they\\nthink the technologist isn\u2019t strong enough to build the product.\\nYou may have to swap out one or more founders, and/or add\\none or more founders.\\nI put this one right up front because it can be a huge issue and\\nthe odds of someone being honest with you about it in the speciXc are not that high.\\nMarket risk \u2014 you probably need to validate the market, at a\\npractical level. Sometimes more detailed and analytical market\\nresearch will solve the problem, but more oaen you actually\\nneed to go get some customers to demonstrate that the market\\nexists. Preferably, paying customers. Or at least credible\\nprospects who will talk to VCs to validate the market hypothesis.\\nCompetition risk \u2014 is your diWerentiation really sharp enough?\\n14 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nRethink this one from the ground up. Lots of startups do not\\nhave strong enough diWerentiation out of the gate, even aaer\\nthey get funded. If you don\u2019t have a really solid idea as to how\\nyou\u2019re dramatically diWerent from or advantaged over known\\nand unknown competitors, you might not want to start a company in the Xrst place.\\nTwo additional points on competition risk that founders routinely screw up in VC pitches:\\nNever, ever say that you have no competitors. That signals\\nnaivete. Great markets draw competitors, and so if you really\\nhave no competition, you must not be in a great market. Even\\nif you really believe you have no competitors, create a competitive landscape slide with adjacent companies in related market\\nsegments and be ready to talk crisply about how you are like and\\nunlike those adjacent companies.\\nAnd never, ever say your market projections indicate you\u2019re\\ngoing to be hugely successful if you get only 2% of your\\n(extremely large) market. That also signals naivete. If you\u2019re\\ngoing aaer 2% of a large market, that means the presumably\\nlarger companies that are going to take the other 98% are going\\nto kill you. You have to have a theory for how you\u2019re going to get\\na signiXcantly higher market share than 2%. (I pick 2% because\\nthat\u2019s the cliche, but if you\u2019re a VC, you\u2019ve probably heard someone use it.)\\nTiming risk \u2014 the only thing to do here is to make more\\nprogress, and demonstrate that you\u2019re not too early or too late.\\nGetting customers in the bag is the most valuable thing you can\\ndo on this one.\\nFinancing risk \u2014 rethink very carefully how much money you\\nwill need to raise aaer this round of Xnancing, and try to change\\nthe plan in plausible ways to require less money. For example,\\nonly serve Cristal at your launch party, and not Remy Martin\\n\u201cBlack Pearl\u201d Louis XIII cognac.\\nMarketing risk \u2014 Xrst, make sure your diWerentiation is superPart 2: When the VCs say \"no\" 15\\nsharp, because without that, you probably won\u2019t be able to stand\\nout from the noise.\\nThen, model out your customer acquisition economics in detail\\nand make sure that you can show how you\u2019ll get more revenue\\nfrom a customer than it will cost in sales and marketing expense\\nto acquire that customer. This is a common problem for startups pursuing the small business market, for example.\\nIf it turns out you need a lot of money in absolute terms for\\nmarketing, look for alternate approaches \u2014 perhaps guerilla\\nmarketing, or some form of virality.\\nDistribution risk \u2014 this is a very tough one \u2014 if your plan has\\ndistribution risk, which is to say you need a key distribution\\npartner to make it work, personally I\u2019d recommend shelving the\\nplan and doing something else. Otherwise, you may need to go\\nget the distribution deal before you can raise money, which is\\nalmost impossible.\\nTechnology risk \u2014 there\u2019s only one way around this, which is to\\nbuild the product, or at least get it to beta, and then raise money.\\nProduct risk \u2014 same answer \u2014 build it.\\nHiring risk \u2014 the best way to address this is to Xgure out which\\nposition/positions the VCs are worried about, and add it/them\\nto the founding team. This will mean additional dilution for\\nyou, but it\u2019s probably the only way to solve the problem.\\nLocation risk \u2014 this is the one you\u2019re really not going to like. If\\nyou\u2019re not in a major center of entrepreneurialism and you\u2019re\\nhaving trouble raising money, you probably need to move.\\nThere\u2019s a reason why most Xlms get made in Los Angeles, and\\nthere\u2019s a reason most venture-backed US tech startups happen\\nin Silicon Valley and handful of other places \u2014 that\u2019s where the\\nmoney is. You can start a company wherever you want, but you\\nmay not be able to get it funded there.\\nYou\u2019ll notice that a lot of what you may need to do is kick the ball\\nfurther down the road \u2014 make more progress against your plan\\nbefore you raise venture capital.\\n16 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nThis obviously raises the issue of how you\u2019re supposed to do\\nthat before you\u2019ve raised money.\\nTry to raise angel money, or bootstrap oW of initial customers\\nor consulting contracts, or work on it aaer hours while keeping\\nyour current job, or quit your job and live oW of credit cards for\\na while.\\nLots of entrepreneurs have done these things and succeeded \u2014\\nand of course, many have failed.\\nNobody said this would be easy.\\nThe most valuable thing you can do is actually build your product. When in doubt, focus on that.\\nThe next most valuable thing you can do is get customers \u2014 or,\\nfor a consumer Internet service, establish a pattern of page view\\ngrowth.\\nThe whole theory of venture capital is that VCs are investing\\nin risk \u2014 another term for venture capital is \u201crisk capital\u201d \u2014\\nbut the reality is that VCs will only take on so much risk, and\\nthe best thing you can do to optimize your chances of raising\\nmoney is to take out risk.\\nPeel away at the onion.\\nThen, once you\u2019ve done that, recraa the pitch around the new\\nfacts. Go do the pitches again. And repeat as necessary.\\nAnd to end on a happy note, remember that \u201cyes\u201d can turn into\\n\u201cno\u201d at any point up until the cash hits your company\u2019s bank\\naccount.\\nSo keep your options open all the way to the end.\\nPart 2: When the VCs say \"no\" 17\\nPart 3: \"But I don\\'t know any VCs!\"\\nIn my last post in this series, When the VCs say \u201cno\u201d, I discussed\\nwhat to do once you have been turned down for venture funding for the Xrst time.\\nHowever, this presupposes you\u2019ve been able to pitch VCs in the\\nXrst place. What if you have a startup for which you\u2019d like to\\nraise venture funding, but you don\u2019t know any VCs?\\nI can certainly sympathize with this problem \u2014 when I was in\\ncollege working on Mosaic at the University of Illinois, the term\\n\u201cventure capital\u201d might as well have been \u201cklaatu barada nikto\u201d\\nfor all I knew. I had never met a venture capitalist, no venture\\ncapitalist had ever talked to me, and I wouldn\u2019t have recognized\\none if I\u2019d stumbled over his checkbook on the sidewalk. Without\\nJim Clark, I\u2019m not at all certain I would have been able to raise\\nmoney to start a company like Netscape, had it even occured to\\nme to start a company in the Xrst place.\\nThe starting point for raising money from VCs when you don\u2019t\\nknow any VCs is to realize that VCs work mostly through referrals \u2014 they hear about a promising startup or entrepreneur\\nfrom someone they have worked with before, like another\\nentrepreneur, an executive or engineer at one of the startups\\nthey have funded, or an angel investor with whom they have\\npreviously co-invested.\\nThe reason for this is simply the math: any individual VC can\\nonly fund a few companies per year, and for every one she\\nfunds, she probably meets with 15 or 20, and there are hundreds\\nmore that would like to meet with her that she doesn\u2019t possibly\\nhave time to meet with. She has to rely on her network to help\\nher screen the hundreds down to 15 or 20, so she can spend her\\ntime Xnding the right one out of the 15 or 20.\\nTherefore, submitting a business plan \u201cover the transom\u201d, or\\nunsolicited, to a venture Xrm is likely to amount to just as much\\nas submitting a screenplay \u201cover the transom\u201d to a Hollywood\\ntalent agency \u2014 that is, precisely nothing.\\nSo the primary trick becomes getting yourself into a position\\nwhere you\u2019re one of the 15 or 20 a particular venture capitalist\\nis meeting with based on referrals from her network, not one of\\nthe hundreds of people who don\u2019t come recommended by anyone and whom she has no intention of meeting.\\nBut before you think about doing that, the Xrst order of business\\nis to (paraphrasing for a family audience) \u201chave your stuG\\ntogether\u201d \u2014 create and develop your plan, your presentation,\\nand your supporting materials so that when you do meet with a\\nVC, you impress her right out of the gate as bringing her a fundable startup founded by someone who knows what he \u2014 that\u2019s\\nyou \u2014 is doing.\\nMy recommendation is to read up on all the things you should\\ndo to put together a really eWective business plan and presentation, and then pretend you have already been turned down once\\n\u2014 then go back to my last post and go through all the diWerent\\nthings you should anticipate and Xx before you actually do walk\\nthrough the door.\\nOne of the reason VCs only meet with startups through their\\nnetworks is because too many of the hundreds of other startups\\nthat they could meet with come across as amateurish and uninformed, and therefore not fundable, when they do take meetings with them. So you have a big opportunity to cut through\\nthe noise by making a great Hrst impression \u2014 which requires\\nreally thinking things through ahead of time and doing all the\\nhard work up front to really make your pitch and plan a masterpiece.\\nPart 3: \"But I don\\'t know any VCs!\" 19\\nWorking backwards from that, the best thing you can walk in\\nwith is a working product. Or, if you can\u2019t get to a working\\nproduct without raising venture funding, then at least a beta\\nor prototype of some form \u2014 a web site that works but hasn\u2019t\\nlaunched, or a soaware mockup with partial functionality,\\nor something. And of course it\u2019s even better if you walk in with\\nexisting \u201ctraction\u201d of some form \u2014 customers, beta customers,\\nsome evidence of adoption by Internet users, whatever is appropriate for your particular startup.\\nWith a working product that could be the foundation of a fundable startup, you have a much better chance of getting funded\\nonce you do get in the door. Back to my rule of thumb from\\nthe last post: when in doubt, work on the product.\\nFailing a working product and ideally customers or users, be\\nsure to have as Ieshed out a presentation as you possibly can\\n\u2014 including mockups, screenshots, market analyses, customer\\nresearch such as interviews with real prospects, and the like.\\nDon\u2019t bother with a long detailed written business plan. Most\\nVCs will either fund a startup based on a Yeshed out Powerpoint\\npresentation of about 20 slides, or they won\u2019t fund it at all.\\nCorollary: any VC who requires a long detailed written business\\nplan is probably not the right VC to be working with.\\nNext: qualify, qualify, qualify. Do extensive research on venture capitalists and Xnd the ones who focus on the sector relevant to your startup. It is completely counterproductive to\\neveryone involved for you to pitch a health care VC on a consumer Internet startup, or vice versa. Individual VCs are usually\\nquite focused in the kinds of companies they are looking for,\\nand identifying those VCs and screening out all the others is\\nabsolutely key.\\nNow, on to developing contacts\\nThe best way to develop contacts with VCs, in my opinion, is to\\nwork at a venture-backed startup, kick butt, get promoted, and\\nnetwork the whole way.\\n20 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nIf you can\u2019t get hired by a venture-backed startup right now,\\nwork at a well-regarded large tech company that employs a lot\\nof people like Google or Apple, gain experience, and then go to\\nwork at a venture-backed startup, kick butt, get promoted, and\\nnetwork the whole way.\\nAnd if you can\u2019t get hired by a well-regarded large tech company, go get a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degree at a major research\\nuniversity from which well-regarded large tech companies regularly recruit, then work at a well-regarded large tech company\\nthat employs a lot of people like Google or Apple, gain experience, and then go to work at a venture-backed startup, kick butt,\\nget promoted, and network the whole way.\\nI sound like I\u2019m joking, but I\u2019m completely serious \u2014 this is the\\npath taken by many venture-backed entrepreneurs I know.\\nSome alternate techniques that don\u2019t take\\nquite as long\\nIf you\u2019re still in school, immediately transfer to, or plan on\\ngoing to graduate school at, a large research university with\\nwell-known connections to the venture capital community, like\\nStanford or MIT.\\nGraduate students at Stanford are directly responsible for such\\ncompanies as Sun, Cisco, Yahoo, and Google, so needless to say,\\nSilicon Valley VCs are continually on the prowl on the Stanford\\nengineering campus for the next Jerry Yang or Larry Page.\\n(In contrast, the University of Illinois, where I went to school, is\\nmostly prowled by mutant cold-weather cows.)\\nAlternately, jump all over Y Combinator. This program, created by entrepreneur Paul Graham and his partners, funds\\nearly-stage startups in an organized program in Silicon Valley\\nand Boston and then makes sure the good ones get in front of\\nventure capitalists for follow-on funding. It\u2019s a great idea and a\\nhuge opportunity for the people who participate in it.\\nPart 3: \"But I don\\'t know any VCs!\" 21\\nRead VC blogs \u2014 read them all, and read them very very carefully. VCs who blog are doing entrepreneurs a huge service both\\nin conveying highly useful information as well as frequently\\nputting themselves out there to be contacted by entrepreneurs\\nin various ways including email, comments, and even uploaded\\npodcasts. Each VC is diWerent in terms of how she wants to\\nengage with people online, but by all means read as many VC\\nblogs as you can and interact with as many of them as you can\\nin appropriate ways.\\nAt the very least you will start to get a really good sense of which\\nVCs who blog are interested in which kinds of companies.\\nAt best, a VC blogger may encourage her readers to communicate with her in various ways, including soliciting email pitches\\nin certain startup categories of interest to her.\\nFred Wilson of Union Square Ventures has even gone so far as\\nto encourage entrepreneurs to record and upload audio pitches\\nfor new ventures so he can listen to them on his IPod. I don\u2019t\\nknow if he\u2019s still doing that, but it\u2019s worth reading his blog and\\nXnding out.\\nAlong those lines, some VCs are aggressive early adopters of\\nnew forms of communication and interaction \u2014 current examples being Facebook and Twitter. Observationally, when a VC is\\nexploring a new communiation medium like Facebook or Twitter, she can be more interested in interacting with various people over that new medium than she might otherwise be. So,\\nwhen such a new thing comes out \u2014 like, hint hint, Facebook or\\nTwitter \u2014 jump all over it, see which VCs are using it, and interact with them that way \u2014 sensibly, of course.\\nMore generally, it\u2019s a good idea for entrepreneurs who are\\nlooking for funding to blog \u2014 about their startup, about interesting things going on, about their point of view. This puts an\\nentrepreneur in the Yow of conversation, which can lead to\\ninteraction with VCs through the normal medium of blogging.\\nAnd, when a VC does decide to take a look at you and your company, she can read your blog to get a sense of who you are and\\n22 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nhow you think. It\u2019s another great opportunity to put forward a\\nfantastic Xrst impression.\\nFinally, if you are a programmer, I highly encourage you, if you\\nhave time, to create or contribute to a meaningful open source\\nproject. The open source movement is an amazing opportunity\\nfor programmers all over the world to not only build useful\\nsoaware that lots of people can use, but also build their own reputations completely apart from whatever day jobs they happen\\nto have. Being able to email a VC and say, \u201cI\u2019m the creator of\\nopen source program X which has 50,000 users worldwide, and\\nI want to tell you about my new startup\u201d is a lot more eWective\\nthan your normal pitch.\\nIf you engage in a set of these techniques over time,\\nyou should be able to interact with at least a few VCs in ways that\\nthey Xnd useful and that might lead to further conversations\\nabout funding, or even introductions to other VCs.\\nI\u2019m personally hoping that the next Google comes out of a VC\\nbeing sent an email pitch aaer the entrepreneur read that VC\u2019s\\nblog. Then every VC on the planet will suddenly start blogging,\\novernight.\\nIf none of those ideas work for you\\nYour alternatives in reverse (declining) order of preference for\\nfunding are, in my view: angel funding, bootstrapping via consulting contracts or early customers, keeping your day job and\\nworking on your startup in your spare time, and credit card\\ndebt.\\nAngel funding \u2014 funding from individuals who like to invest\\nsmall amounts of money in early-stage startups, oaen before\\nVCs come in \u2014 can be a great way to go since good angels know\\ngood VCs and will be eager to introduce you to them so that\\nyour company goes on to be successful for the angel as well as\\nfor you.\\nPart 3: \"But I don\\'t know any VCs!\" 23\\nThis of course begs the question of how to raise angel money,\\nwhich is another topic altogether!\\nI am not encouraging the other three alternatives \u2014 bootstrapping, working on it part time, or credit card debt. Each has\\nserious problems. But, it is easy to name highly successful entrepreneurs who have followed each of those paths, so they are\\nworth noting.\\n24 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nPart 4: The only thing that matters\\nThis post is all about the only thing that matters for a new\\nstartup.\\nBut Xrst, some theory:\\nIf you look at a broad cross-section of startups \u2014 say, 30 or 40\\nor more; enough to screen out the pure Yukes and look for patterns \u2014 two obvious facts will jump out at you.\\nFirst obvious fact: there is an incredibly wide divergence of success \u2014 some of those startups are insanely successful, some\\nhighly successful, many somewhat successful, and quite a few of\\ncourse outright fail.\\nSecond obvious fact: there is an incredibly wide divergence of\\ncaliber and quality for the three core elements of each startup\\n\u2014 team, product, and market.\\nAt any given startup, the team will range from outstanding to\\nremarkably Yawed; the product will range from a masterpiece\\nof engineering to barely functional; and the market will range\\nfrom booming to comatose.\\nAnd so you start to wonder \u2014 what correlates the most to success \u2014 team, product, or market? Or, more bluntly, what causes\\nsuccess? And, for those of us who are students of startup failure\\n\u2014 what\u2019s most dangerous: a bad team, a weak product, or a\\npoor market?\\nLet\u2019s start by deXning terms.\\nThe caliber of a startup team can be deXned as the suitability of\\nthe CEO, senior staW, engineers, and other key staW relative to\\nthe opportunity in front of them.\\nYou look at a startup and ask, will this team be able to optimally\\nexecute against their opportunity? I focus on eWectiveness as\\nopposed to experience, since the history of the tech industry is\\nfull of highly successful startups that were staWed primarily by\\npeople who had never \u201cdone it before\u201d.\\nThe quality of a startup\u2019s product can be deXned as how impressive the product is to one customer or user who actually uses\\nit: How easy is the product to use? How feature rich is it? How\\nfast is it? How extensible is it? How polished is it? How many (or\\nrather, how few) bugs does it have?\\nThe size of a startup\u2019s market is the the number, and growth\\nrate, of those customers or users for that product.\\n(Let\u2019s assume for this discussion that you can make money at\\nscale \u2014 that the cost of acquiring a customer isn\u2019t higher than\\nthe revenue that customer will generate.)\\nSome people have been objecting to my classiXcation as follows:\\n\u201cHow great can a product be if nobody wants it?\u201d In other words,\\nisn\u2019t the quality of a product deXned by how appealing it is to\\nlots of customers?\\nNo. Product quality and market size are completely diWerent.\\nHere\u2019s the classic scenario: the world\u2019s best soaware application\\nfor an operating system nobody runs. Just ask any soaware\\ndeveloper targeting the market for BeOS, Amiga, OS/2, or\\nNeXT applications what the diWerence is between great product\\nand big market.\\nSo:\\nIf you ask entrepreneurs or VCs which of team, product, or market is most important, many will say team. This is the obvious\\n26 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nanswer, in part because in the beginning of a startup, you know\\na lot more about the team than you do the product, which hasn\u2019t\\nbeen built yet, or the market, which hasn\u2019t been explored yet.\\nPlus, we\u2019ve all been raised on slogans like \u201cpeople are our most\\nimportant asset\u201d \u2014 at least in the US, pro-people sentiments\\npermeate our culture, ranging from high school self-esteem\\nprograms to the Declaration of Independence\u2019s inalienable\\nrights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness \u2014 so the\\nanswer that team is the most important feels right.\\nAnd who wants to take the position that people don\u2019t matter?\\nOn the other hand, if you ask engineers, many will say product.\\nThis is a product business, startups invent products, customers\\nbuy and use the products. Apple and Google are the best companies in the industry today because they build the best products. Without the product there is no company. Just try having\\na great team and no product, or a great market and no product.\\nWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Now let me get back to work on the\\nproduct.\\nPersonally, I\u2019ll take the third position \u2014 I\u2019ll assert that market is\\nthe most important factor in a startup\u2019s success or failure.\\nWhy?\\nIn a great market \u2014 a market with lots of real potential customers \u2014 the market pulls product out of the startup.\\nThe market needs to be fulXlled and the market will be fulXlled,\\nby the Xrst viable product that comes along.\\nThe product doesn\u2019t need to be great; it just has to basically\\nwork. And, the market doesn\u2019t care how good the team is, as\\nlong as the team can produce that viable product.\\nIn short, customers are knocking down your door to get the\\nproduct; the main goal is to actually answer the phone and\\nrespond to all the emails from people who want to buy.\\nPart 4: The only thing that matters 27\\nAnd when you have a great market, the team is remarkably easy\\nto upgrade on the Yy.\\nThis is the story of search keyword advertising, and Internet\\nauctions, and TCP/IP routers.\\nConversely, in a terrible market, you can have the best product\\nin the world and an absolutely killer team, and it doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 you\u2019re going to fail.\\nYou\u2019ll break your pick for years trying to Xnd customers who\\ndon\u2019t exist for your marvelous product, and your wonderful\\nteam will eventually get demoralized and quit, and your startup\\nwill die.\\nThis is the story of videoconferencing, and workYow soaware,\\nand micropayments.\\nIn honor of Andy RachleW, formerly of Benchmark Capital, who\\ncrystallized this formulation for me, let me present RachleE\u2019s\\nLaw of Startup Success:\\nThe #1 company-killer is lack of market.\\nAndy puts it this way:\\n\u2022 When a great team meets a lousy market, market wins.\\n\u2022 When a lousy team meets a great market, market wins.\\n\u2022 When a great team meets a great market, something special\\nhappens.\\nYou can obviously screw up a great market \u2014 and that has been\\ndone, and not infrequently \u2014 but assuming the team is baseline\\ncompetent and the product is fundamentally acceptable, a great\\nmarket will tend to equal success and a poor market will tend to\\nequal failure. Market matters most.\\nAnd neither a stellar team nor a fantastic product will redeem a\\nbad market.\\nOK, so what?\\n28 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nWell, Hrst question: Since team is the thing you have the most\\ncontrol over at the start, and everyone wants to have a great\\nteam, what does a great team actually get you?\\nHopefully a great team gets you at least an OK product, and ideally a great product.\\nHowever, I can name you a bunch of examples of great teams\\nthat totally screwed up their products. Great products are really,\\nreally hard to build.\\nHopefully a great team also gets you a great market \u2014 but I can\\nalso name you lots of examples of great teams that executed\\nbrilliantly against terrible markets and failed. Markets that don\u2019t\\nexist don\u2019t care how smart you are.\\nIn my experience, the most frequent case of great team paired\\nwith bad product and/or terrible market is the second- or thirdtime entrepreneur whose Xrst company was a huge success.\\nPeople get cocky, and slip up. One highly successful soaware\\nentrepreneur is burning through something like $80 million in\\nventure funding in his latest startup and has practically nothing\\nto show for it except for some great press clippings and a couple of beta customers \u2014 because there is virtually no market for\\nwhat he is building.\\nConversely, I can name you any number of weak teams whose\\nstartups were highly successful due to explosively large markets\\nfor what they were doing.\\nFinally, to quote Tim Shephard: \u201cA great team is a team that will\\nalways beat a mediocre team, given the same market and product.\u201d\\nSecond question: Can\u2019t great products sometimes create huge\\nnew markets?\\nAbsolutely.\\nThis is a best case scenario, though.\\nVMWare is the most recent company to have done it \u2014\\nPart 4: The only thing that matters 29\\nVMWare\u2019s product was so profoundly transformative out of the\\ngate that it catalyzed a whole new movement toward operating\\nsystem virtualization, which turns out to be a monster market.\\nAnd of course, in this scenario, it also doesn\u2019t really matter\\nhow good your team is, as long as the team is good enough to\\ndevelop the product to the baseline level of quality the market\\nrequires and get it fundamentally to market.\\nUnderstand I\u2019m not saying that you should shoot low in terms of quality\\nof team, or that VMWare\u2019s team was not incredibly strong \u2014\\nit was, and is. I\u2019m saying, bring a product as transformative as\\nVMWare\u2019s to market and you\u2019re going to succeed, full stop.\\nShort of that, I wouldn\u2019t count on your product creating a new\\nmarket from scratch.\\nThird question: as a startup founder, what should I do about\\nall this?\\nLet\u2019s introduce RachleE\u2019s Corollary of Startup Success:\\nThe only thing that matters is getting to product/market Ft.\\nProduct/market Xt means being in a good market with a product\\nthat can satisfy that market.\\nYou can always feel when product/market Ft isn\u2019t happening. The\\ncustomers aren\u2019t quite getting value out of the product, word\\nof mouth isn\u2019t spreading, usage isn\u2019t growing that fast, press\\nreviews are kind of \u201cblah\u201d, the sales cycle takes too long, and lots\\nof deals never close.\\nAnd you can always feel product/market Ft when it\u2019s happening. The\\ncustomers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it\\n\u2014 or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers.\\nMoney from customers is piling up in your company checking\\naccount. You\u2019re hiring sales and customer support staW as fast as\\nyou can. Reporters are calling because they\u2019ve heard about your\\nhot new thing and they want to talk to you about it. You start\\ngetting entrepreneur of the year awards from Harvard Busi30 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nness School. Investment bankers are staking out your house. You\\ncould eat free for a year at Buck\u2019s.\\nLots of startups fail before product/market Ht ever happens.\\nMy contention, in fact, is that they fail because they never get to\\nproduct/market Xt.\\nCarried a step further, I believe that the life of any startup can be\\ndivided into two parts: before product/market Ft (call this \u201cBPMF\u201d)\\nand aMer product/market Ft (\u201cAPMF\u201d).\\nWhen you are BPMF, focus obsessively on getting to product/\\nmarket Ht.\\nDo whatever is required to get to product/market Ht. Including\\nchanging out people, rewriting your product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don\u2019t want to,\\ntelling customers yes when you don\u2019t want to, raising that fourth\\nround of highly dilutive venture capital \u2014 whatever is required.\\nWhen you get right down to it, you can ignore almost everything else.\\nI\u2019m not suggesting that you do ignore everything else \u2014 just that\\njudging from what I\u2019ve seen in successful startups, you can.\\nWhenever you see a successful startup, you see one that has\\nreached product/market Ht \u2014 and usually along the way\\nscrewed up all kinds of other things, from channel model to\\npipeline development strategy to marketing plan to press relations to compensation policies to the CEO sleeping with the\\nventure capitalist. And the startup is still successful.\\nConversely, you see a surprising number of really well-run\\nstartups that have all aspects of operations completely buttoned\\ndown, HR policies in place, great sales model, thoroughly\\nthought-through marketing plan, great interview processes,\\noutstanding catered food, 30\u2033 monitors for all the programmers, top tier VCs on the board \u2014 heading straight oG a cliG\\ndue to not ever Hnding product/market Ht.\\nPart 4: The only thing that matters 31\\nIronically, once a startup is successful, and you ask the founders\\nwhat made it successful, they will usually cite all kinds of things\\nthat had nothing to do with it. People are terrible at understanding causation. But in almost every case, the cause was actually\\nproduct/market Xt.\\nBecause, really, what else could it possibly be?\\n[Editorial note: this post obviously raises way more questions than it\\nanswers. How exactly do you go about getting to product/market Ft if\\nyou don\u2019t hit it right out of the gate? How do you evaluate markets for\\nsize and quality, especially before they\u2019re fully formed? What actually\\nmakes a product \u201cFt\u201d a market? What role does timing play? How do\\nyou know when to change strategy and go aMer a diEerent market or\\nbuild a diEerent product? When do you need to change out some or all\\nof your team? And why can\u2019t you count on on a great team to build the\\nright product and Fnd the right market? All these topics will be discussed in future posts in this series.]\\n32 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nPart 5: The Moby Dick theory of big\\ncompanies\\n\u201cThere she blows,\u201d was sung out from the mast-head.\\n\u201cWhere away?\u201d demanded the captain.\\n\u201cThree points oE the lee bow, sir.\u201d\\n\u201cRaise up your wheel.

Too much?\\nIn this post, I answer these questions:\\nHow much funding for a startup is too little?\\nHow much funding for a startup is too much?\\nAnd how can you know, and what can you do about it?\\nThe Xrst question to ask is, what is the correct, or appropriate,\\namount of funding for a startup?\\nThe answer to that question, in my view, is based my theory that\\na startup\u2019s life can be divided into two parts \u2014 Before Product/\\nMarket Fit, and AMer Product/Market Fit.\\nBefore Product/Market Fit, a startup should ideally raise at\\nleast enough money to get to Product/Market Fit.\\nALer Product/Market Fit, a startup should ideally raise at least\\nenough money to fully exploit the opportunity in front of it,\\nand then to get to proXtability while still fully exploiting that\\nopportunity.\\nI will further argue that the deXnition of \u201cat least enough\\nmoney\u201d in each case should include a substantial amount of\\nextra money beyond your default plan, so that you can withstand bad surprises. In other words, insurance. This is partic-\\nularly true for startups that have not yet achieved Product/\\nMarket Fit, since you have no real idea how long that will take.\\nThese answers all sound obvious, but in my experience, a surprising number of startups go out to raise funding and do not\\nhave an underlying theory of how much money they are raising\\nand for precisely what purpose they are raising it.\\nWhat if you can\u2019t raise that much money at\\nonce?\\nObviously, many startups Xnd that they cannot raise enough\\nmoney at one time to accomplish these objectives \u2014 but I\\nbelieve this is still the correct underlying theory for how much\\nmoney a startup should raise and around which you should orient your thinking.\\nIf you are Before Product/Market Fit and you can\u2019t raise\\nenough money in one shot to get to Product/Market Fit, then\\nyou will need get as far as you can on each round and demonstrate progress towards Product/Market Fit when you raise each\\nnew round.\\nIf you are ALer Product/Market Fit and you can\u2019t raise enough\\nmoney in one shot to fully exploit your opportunity, you have\\na high-class problem and will probably \u2014 but not deXnitely \u2014\\nXnd that it gets continually easier to raise new money as you\\nneed it.\\nWhat if you don\u2019t want to raise that much\\nmoney at once?\\nYou can argue you should raise a smaller amount of money at\\na time, because if you are making progress \u2014 either BPMF or\\nAPMF \u2014 you can raise the rest of the money you need later, at\\na higher valuation, and give away less of the company.\\nThis is the reason some entrepreneurs who can raise a lot of\\nmoney choose to hold back.\\n42 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nHere\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t do that:\\nWhat are the consequences of not raising enough money?\\nNot raising enough money risks the survival of your company,\\nfor the following reasons:\\nFirst, you may have \u2014 and probably will have \u2014 unanticipated\\nsetbacks within your business.\\nMaybe a new product release slips, or you have unexpected\\nquality issues, or one of your major customers goes bankrupt, or\\na challenging new competitor emerges, or you get sued by a big\\ncompany for patent infringement, or you lose a key engineer.\\nSecond, the funding window may not be open when you need\\nmore money.\\nSometimes investors are highly enthusiastic about funding new\\nbusinesses, and sometimes they\u2019re just not.\\nWhen they\u2019re not \u2014 when the \u201cwindow is shut\u201d, as the saying\\ngoes \u2014 it is very hard to convince them otherwise, even though\\nthose are many of the best times to invest in startups because\\nof the prevailing atmosphere of fear and dread that is holding\\neveryone else back.\\nThose of us who were in startups that lived through 2001-2003\\nknow exactly what this can be like.\\nThird, something completely unanticipated, and bad, might\\nhappen.\\nAnother major terrorist attack is the one that I frankly worry\\nabout the most. A superbug. All-out war in the Middle East.\\nNorth Korea demonstrating the ability to launch a true nucleartipped ICBM. Giant Yaming meteorites. Such worst-case scenarios will not only close the funding window, they might keep\\nit closed for a long time.\\nFunny story: it turns out that a lot of Internet business models\\nfrom the late 90\u2019s that looked silly at the time actually work\\nPart 6: How much funding is too little? Too much? 43\\nreally well \u2014 either in their original form or with some tweaking.\\nAnd there are quite a few startups from the late 90\u2019s that are\\ndoing just great today \u2014 examples being OpenTable (which is\\nabout to go public) and TellMe (which recently sold itself to\\nMicrosoa for $800 million), and my own company Opsware\\n\u2014 which would be bankrupt today if we hadn\u2019t raised a ton of\\nmoney when we could, and instead just did its Xrst $100 million\\nrevenue year and has a roughly $1 billion public market value.\\nI\u2019ll go so far as to say that the big diWerence between the startups\\nfrom that era that are doing well today versus the ones that no\\nlonger exist, is that the former group raised a ton of money\\nwhen they could, and the latter did not.\\nSo how much money should I raise?\\nIn general, as much as you can. Without giving away control of\\nyour company, and without being insane.\\nEntrepreneurs who try to play it too aggressive and hold back\\non raising money when they can because they think they can\\nraise it later occasionally do very well, but are gambling their\\nwhole company on that strategy in addition to all the normal\\nstartup risks.\\nSuppose you raise a lot of money and you do really well. You\u2019ll\\nbe really happy and make a lot of money, even if you don\u2019t make\\nquite as much money as if you had rolled the dice and raised\\nless money up front.\\nSuppose you don\u2019t raise a lot of money when you can and it\\nbackXres. You lose your company, and you\u2019ll be really, really sad.\\nIs it really worth that risk?\\nThere is one additional consequence to raising a lot of money\\nthat you should bear in mind, although it is more important for\\nsome companies than others.\\n44 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nThat is liquidation preference. In the scenario where your\\ncompany ultimately gets acquired: the more money you raise\\nfrom outside investors, the higher the acquisition price has to be\\nfor the founders and employees to make money on top of the\\ninitial payout to the investors.\\nIn other words, raising a lot of money can make it much harder\\nto eWectively sell your company for less than a very high price,\\nwhich you may not be able to get when the time comes.\\nIf you are convinced that your company is going to get bought,\\nand you don\u2019t think the purchase price will be that high, then\\nraising less money is a good idea purely in terms of optimizing\\nfor your own Xnancial outcome. However, that strategy has lots\\nof other risks and will be addressed in another entertaining post,\\nto be entitled \u201cWhy building to Yip is a bad idea\u201d.\\nTaking these factors into account, though, in a normal scenario,\\nraising more money rather than less usually makes sense,\\nsince you are buying yourself insurance against both internal\\nand external potential bad events \u2014 and that is more important than worrying too much about dilution or liquidation preference.\\nHow much money is too much?\\nThere are downside consequences to raising too much money.\\nI already discussed two of them \u2014 possibly incremental dilution\\n(which I dismissed as a real concern in most situations), and possibly excessively high liquidation preference (which should be\\nmonitored but not obsessed over).\\nThe big downside consequence to too much money, though,\\nis cultural corrosion.\\nYou don\u2019t have to be in this industry very long before you run\\ninto the startup that has raised a ton of money and has become\\ninfected with a culture of complacency, laziness, and arrogance.\\nRaising a ton of money feels really good \u2014 you feel like you\u2019ve\\nPart 6: How much funding is too little?

Edison went on, of course, to become one of the\\ngreatest inventors and innovators of all time.\\nAs our story begins, Edison, an unknown inventor running his\\nown startup, is focused on developing better hardware for telegraph operators. He is particularly focused on equipment for\\ntelegraph operators to be able to send voice messages over telegraph lines.\\nCue the book:\\nThe day aaer Edison had noted the idea for recording voice messages received by a telegraphy oZce, he came up with a variation.\\nThat evening, on 18 July 1877, when [his lab\u2019s] midnight dinner\\nhad been consumed\u2026 [Edison] turned around to face [his assistant\\nCharles Batchelor] and casually remarked, \u201cBatch, if we had a point\\non this, we could make a record of some material which we could\\naaerwards pull under the point, and it would give us the speech\\nback.\u201d\\nAs soon as Edison had pointed it out, it seemed so obvious that they\\ndid not pause to appreciate\u2026 the suggestion. Everyone jumped up\\nto rig a test\u2026 within an hour, they had the gizmo set up on the\\ntable\u2026 Edison sat down, leaned into the mouthpiece\u2026 [and] delivered the stock phrase the lab used to test telephone diaphragms:\\n\u201cMary had a little lamb.\u201d\\n\u2026Batchelor reinserted the beginning of the [strip on which the\\nphrase had been recorded]\u2026 out came \u201cary ad ell am.\u201d \u201cIt was not\\nXne talking,\u201d Batchelor recalled, \u201cbut the shape of it was there.\u201d\\nThe men celebrated with a whoop, shook hands with one another,\\nand worked on. By breakfast the following morning, they had\\nsucceeded in getting clear articulation from waxed paper, the Xrst\\nrecording medium \u2014 in the Xrst midnight recording session.\\n50 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\n\u2026The discovery was treated suprisingly casually in the lab\u2019s notebooks\u2026\\nIt was a singular moment in the modern history of invention, but,\\nin the years that would follow, Edison would never tell the story the\\nway it actually unfolded that summer, always moving the events\\nfrom July 1877 to December. We may guess the reason why: in July,\\nhe and his assistants failed to appreciate what they had discovered.\\nAt the time, they were working feverishly to develop a set of working telephones to show their best prospect\u2026 Western Union\u2026 There\\nwas no time to pause and reYect on the incidental invention of what\\nwas the Xrst working model of the phonograph\u2026\\nThe invention continued to be labeled in the notebooks with the\\nbroader rubric \u201cspeaking telegraph\u201d, reYecting the assumption that\\nit would be put to use in the telegraph oZce, recording messages.\\nAn unidentiXed staW member draw up a list of possible names\\nfor the machine, which included: tel-autograph, tel-autophone,\\n\u201cchronophone = time-announcer = speaking clock\u201d, \u201cdidaskophone\\n= teaching speaker = portable teacher\u201d, \u201cglottophone = language\\nsounder or speaker\u201d, \u201cclimatophone = weather announcer\u201d, \u201cklangophone = bird cry sounder\u201d, \u201chulagmophone = barking sounder\u201d\u2026\\n\u2026In October 1877, [Edison] wrote his father that he was \u201cat present\\nvery hard up for cash,\u201d but if his \u201cspeaking telegraph\u201d was successful, he would receive an advance on royalties.

This is a topic that could Xll a\\nwhole book, but in this post I will provide speciXc guidelines on\\nhow to hire, manage, promote, and Xre executives in a startup\\nbased on my personal observations and experiences.\\nFor the purposes of this post, deXnitions: An executive is\\na leader \u2014 someone who runs a function within the company\\nand has primary responsibility for an organization within the\\ncompany that will contribute to the company\u2019s success or failure. The diWerence between an executive and a manager is that\\nthe executive has a higher degree of latitude to organize, make\\ndecisions, and execute within her function than a manager. The\\nmanager may ask what the right thing to do is; the executive should\\nknow.\\nThe general theory of executives, like managers, is, per Andy\\nGrove: the output of an executive is the output of her organization.\\nTherefore, the primary task of an executive is to maximize the\\noutput of her organization. However, in a startup, a successful\\nexecutive must accomplish three other critical tasks simultaneously:\\n\u2022 Build her organization\u2013 typically when an executive arrives\\nor is promoted into her role at a startup, she isn\u2019t there to be\\na caretaker; rather she must build her organization, oaen\\nfrom scratch. This is a sharp diWerence from many big\\ncompany executives, who can spend their entire careers\\nrunning organizations other people built \u2014 oaen years or\\ndecades earlier.\\n\u2022 Be a primary individual contributor\u2013 a startup executive\\nmust \u201croll up her sleeves\u201d and produce output herself. There\\nare no shortage of critical things to be done at a startup, and\\nan executive who cannot personally produce while\\nsimultaneously building and running her organization\\ntypically will not last long. Again, this is a sharp diWerence\\nfrom many big companies, where executives oaen serve\\nmore as administrators and bureaucrats.\\n\u2022 Be a team player\u2013 a startup executive must take personal\\nresponsibility for her relationships with her peers and people\\nthroughout the startup, in all functions and at all levels. Big\\ncompanies can oaen tolerate internal rivalries and warfare;\\nstartups cannot.\\nBeing a startup executive is not an easy job. The rewards are\\nsubstantial \u2014 the ability to contribute directly to the startups\u2019s\\nsuccess; the latitude to build and run an organization according\\nto her own theories and principles; and a meaningful equity\\nstake that can lead to personal Xnancial independence if the\\nstartup succeeds \u2014 but the responsibilities are demanding and\\nintense.\\nHiring\\nFirst, if you\u2019re not sure whether you need an executive for a function,\\ndon\u2019t hire one.\\nStartups, particularly well-funded startups, oaen hire executives\\ntoo early. Particularly before a startup has achieved product/\\nmarket Xt, it is oMen better to have a highly motivated manager or\\ndirector running a function than an executive.\\nHiring an executive too quickly can lead to someone who is\\nreally expensive, sitting there in the middle of the room, doing\\nvery little. Not good for the executive, not good for the rest of\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 55\\nthe team, not good for the burn rate, and not good for the company.\\nHire an executive only when it\u2019s clear that you need one: when an\\norganization needs to get built; when hiring needs to accelerate;\\nwhen you need more processes and structure and rigor to how\\nyou do things.\\nSecond, hire the best person for the next nine months, not the next\\nthree years.\\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of startups overshoot on their executive hires.\\nThey need someone to build the soaware development team\\nfrom four people to 30 people over the next nine months, so\\nthey hire an executive from a big company who has been running 400 people. That is usually death.\\nHire for what you need now \u2014 and for roughly the next nine\\nmonths. At the very least, you will get what you need now, and\\nthe person you hire may well be able to scale and keep going for\\nyears to come.\\nIn contrast, if you overhire \u2014 if you hear yourself saying, \u201cthis\\nperson will be great when we get bigger\u201d \u2014 you are most likely\\nhiring someone who, best case, isn\u2019t that interested in doing\\nthings at the scale you need, and worst case, doesn\u2019t know how.\\nThird, whenever possible, promote from within.\\nGreat companies develop their own executives. There are several reasons for this:\\n\u2022 You get to develop your best people and turn them into\\nexecutives, which is great for both them and you \u2014 this is the\\nsingle best, and usually the only, way to hold onto great\\npeople for long periods of time.\\n\u2022 You ensure that your executives completely know and\\nunderstand your company culture, strategy, and ethics.\\n\u2022 Your existing people are the \u201cdevil you know\u201d \u2014 anyone new\\ncoming from outside is going to have Yaws, oaen really\\nserious ones, but you probably won\u2019t Xgure out what they are\\n56 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nuntil aaer you\u2019ve hired them. With your existing people, you\\nknow, and you minimize your odds of being shocked and\\nappalled.\\nOf course, this isn\u2019t always possible. Which segues us directly\\ninto\u2026\\nFourth, my list of the key things to look at, and for, when evaluating executive candidates:\\n\u2022 Look for someone who is hungry and driven\u2013 someone who\\nwants a shot at doing \u201ctheir thing\u201d. Someone who has been an\\nup and comer at a midsized company but wants a shot at\\nbeing a primary executive at a startup can be a great catch.\\n\u2022 Flip side of that: beware people who have \u201cdone it\\nbefore\u201d.Sometimes you do run into someone who has been VP\\nEngineering at four companies and loves it and wants to do it\\nat a Xah company. More oaen, you will be dealing with\\nsomeone who is no longer hungry and driven. This is a very,\\nvery big problem to end up with \u2014 be very careful.\\n\u2022 Don\u2019t disqualify someone based on ego or cockiness\u2013 as long as\\nshe\u2019s not insane. Great executives are high-ego \u2014 you want\\nsomeone driven to run things, driven to make decisions,\\nconXdent in herself and her abilities. I don\u2019t mean loud and\\nobnoxious, I mean assured and determined, bleeding over\\ninto cocky. If a VC\u2019s ideal investment is a company that will\\nsuccceed without him, then your ideal executive hire is someone who\\nwill succeed without you.\\n\u2022 Beware hiring a big company executive for a startup.The\\nexecutive skill sets required for a big company vs a startup\\nare very Even great big company executives frequently\\nhave no idea what to do once they arrive at a startup.\\n\u2022 In particular, really beware hiring an executive from an incredibly\\nsuccessful big company. This is oaen very tempting \u2014 who\\nwouldn\u2019t want to bring onboard someone who sprinkles\\nsome of that IBM (in the 80\u2019s), Microsoa (in the 90\u2019s), or\\nGoogle (today) fairy dust on your startup? The issue is that\\npeople who have been at an incredibly successful big\\ncompany oaen cannot function in a normal, real world,\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 57\\ncompetitive situation where they don\u2019t start every day with\\n80% market share. Back in the 80\u2019s, you oaen heard, \u201cnever\\nhire anyone straight out of IBM \u2014 Xrst, let them go\\nsomewhere else and fail, and then hire them\u201d. Believe it.\\n\u2022 This probably goes without saying, but look for a pattern of\\noutput\u2013 accomplishment. Validate it by reference checking\\npeers, reports, and bosses. Along the way, reference check\\npersonality and teamwork, but look Xrst and foremost for a\\npattern of output.\\nFiah, by all means, use an executive recruiter, but for sourcing, not\\nevaluation.\\nThere are some executive recruiters who are actually really\\ngood at evaluation. Others are not. It\u2019s beside the point. It\u2019s your\\njob to evaluate and make the decision, not the recruiter\u2019s.\\nI say this because I have never met a recruiter who lacks conXdence in his ability to evaluate candidates and pass judgment on\\nwho\u2019s right for a given situation. This can lull a startup founder\\ninto relying on the recruiter\u2019s judgment instead of really digging\\nin and making your own decision. Betting that your recruiter is\\ngreat at evaluation is not a risk you want to take. You\u2019re the one\\nwho has to Xre the executive if it doesn\u2019t work out.\\nSixth, be ready to pay market compensation, including more cash\\ncompensation than you want, but watch for red Gags in the compensation discussion.\\nYou want someone focused on upside \u2014 on building a company. That means, a focus on their stock option package Xrst\\nand foremost.\\nWatch out for candidates who want egregious amounts of cash,\\nhigh bonuses, restricted stock, vacation days, perks, or \u2014 worst\\nof all \u2014 guaranteed severance. A candiate who is focused on\\nthose things, as opposed to the option package, is not ready to\\ndo a startup.\\nOn a related note, be careful about option accceleration in the\\nevent of change of control. This is oaen reasonable for support\\n58 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nfunctions such as Xnance, legal, and HR where an acquirer\\nwould most likely not have a job for the startup executive in\\nany of those functions. But this is not reasonable, in my view,\\nfor core functions such as engineering, product management,\\nmarketing, or sales. You don\u2019t want your key executives focused\\non selling the company \u2014 unless of course you want them\\nfocused on selling the company. Make your acceleration decisions accordingly.\\nSeventh, when hiring the executive to run your former specialty, be\\ncareful you don\u2019t hire someone weak on purpose.\\nThis sounds silly, but you wouldn\u2019t believe how oaen it happens.\\nThe CEO who used to be a product manager who has a weak\\nproduct management executive. The CEO who used to be in\\nsales who has a weak sales executive. The CEO who used to be\\nin marketing who has a weak marketing executive.\\nI call this the \u201cMichael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\u201d \u2014 aaer the CEO of Disney who had previously been a brilliant TV network executive. When he bought ABC at Disney, it\\npromptly fell to fourth place. His response? \u201cIf I had an extra\\ntwo days a week, I could turn around ABC myself.\u201d Well, guess\\nwhat, he didn\u2019t have an extra two days a week.\\nA CEO \u2014 or a startup founder \u2014 oaen has a hard time letting\\ngo of the function that brought him to the party. The result: you\\nhire someone weak into the executive role for that function so\\nthat you can continue to be \u201cthe man\u201d \u2014 consciously or subconsciously. Don\u2019t let it happen to you \u2014 make sure the person you\\nhire into that role is way better than you used to be.\\nEighth, recognize that hiring an executive is a high-risk proposition.\\nYou oaen see a startup with a screwed up development process,\\nbut \u201cwhen we get our VP of Engineering onboard, everything\\nwill get Xxed\u201d. Or a startup that is missing its revenue targets, but\\n\u201cwhen we get our VP of sales, reveue will take oW\u201d.\\nHere\u2019s the problem: in my experience, if you know what you\u2019re\\ndoing, the odds of a given executive hire working out will be about\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 59\\n50/50. That is, about 50% of the time you\u2019ll screw up and ultimately have to replace the person. (If you don\u2019t know what\\nyou\u2019re doing, your failure rate will be closer to 100%.)\\nWhy? People are people. People are complicated. People have\\nYaws. You oaen don\u2019t know what those Yaws are until aaer you\\nget to know them. Those Yaws are oaen fatal in an executive\\nrole. And more generally, sometimes the Xt just isn\u2019t there.\\nThis is why I\u2019m so gung ho on promoting from within. At least\\nthen you know what the Yaws are up front.\\nManaging\\nFirst, manage your executives.\\nIt\u2019s not that uncommon to see startup founders, especially Xrsttimers, who hire executives and are then reluctant to manage\\nthem.\\nYou can see the thought process: I just hired this really great, really\\nexperienced VP of Engineering who has way more experience running\\ndevelopment teams than I ever did \u2014 I should just let him go do his\\nthing!\\nThat\u2019s a bad idea. While respecting someone\u2019s experience and\\nskills, you should nevertheless manage every executive as if she\\nwere a normal employee. This means weekly 1:1\u2019s, performance\\nreviews, written objectives, career development plans, the whole\\nnine yards. Skimp on this and it is very easy for both your relationship with her and her eWectiveness in the company to skew\\nsideways.\\nThis even holds if you\u2019re 22 and she\u2019s 40, or 50, or 60! Don\u2019t be\\nshy, that will just scare her \u2014 and justiXably so.\\nSecond, give your executives the latitude to run their organizations.\\nThis is the balancing act with the previous point, but it\u2019s equally\\nimportant. Don\u2019t micromanage.\\nThe whole point of having an executive is to have someone who\\n60 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\ncan Xgure out how to build and run an organization so that you\\ndon\u2019t have to. Manage her, understand what she is doing, be\\nvery clear on the results you expect, but let her do the job.\\nHere\u2019s the key corollary to that: if you want to give an executive full\\nlatitude, but you\u2019re reluctant to do so because you\u2019re not sure she can\\nmake it happen, then it\u2019s probably time to Fre her.\\nIn my experience it\u2019s not that uncommon for a founder or CEO\\nto be uncomfortable \u2014 sometimes only at a gut level \u2014 at really\\ngiving an executive the latitude to run with the ball. That is a\\nsureXre signal that the executive is not working out and probably needs to be Xred. More on that below.\\nThird, ruthlessly violate the chain of command in order to gather data.\\nI don\u2019t mean going around telling people under an executive\\nwhat to do without her knowing about it. I mean, ask questions,\\ncontinually, at all levels of the organization. How are things\\ngoing? What do you think of the new hires? How oaen are you\\nmeeting with your manager? And so on.\\nYou never want the bulk of your information about a function\\ncoming from the executive running that function. That\u2019s the\\nbest way to be completely and utterly surprised when everything blows up.\\nHere\u2019s the kicker: a great executive never minds when the CEO talks\\nto people in her organization. In fact, she loves it, because it means\\nthe CEO just hears more great things about her.\\nIf you have an executive who doesn\u2019t want you to talk to people\\nin her organization, you have a bad executive.\\nPromoting\\nThis will be controversial, but I am a big fan of promoting talented\\npeople as fast as you can \u2014 promoting up and comers into executive roles, and promoting executives into bigger and broader\\nresponsibilities.\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 61\\nYou can clearly overdo this \u2014 you can promote someone before\\nthey are ready and in the worst case, completely screw up their\\ncareer. (Seen it. Done it.) You can also promote someone to their\\nlevel of incompetence \u2014 the Peter Principle. (Seen it. Done it.)\\nHowever, life is short, startups move fast, and you have stuE to get\\ndone. You aren\u2019t going to have the privilege of working with\\nthat many great, talented, high-potential people in your career.\\nWhen you Xnd one, promote her as fast as you can. Great for\\nher, great for the company, and great for you.\\nThis assumes you are properly training and managing her along the\\nway. That is lea as an exercise for the reader.\\nThe surest sign someone is ready for promotion is when they\u2019re doing\\na great job running their current team. Projects are getting done,\\nteam morale is good, new hires are top quality, people are\\nhappy. Time to promote some people into new challenges.\\nI\u2019m a Xrm believer that most people who do great things are doing\\nthem for the Frst time. Returning to my theory of hiring, I\u2019d rather\\nhave someone all Xred up to do something for the Xrst time\\nthan someone who\u2019s done it before and isn\u2019t that excited to do it\\nagain. You rarely go wrong giving someone who is high potential the shot.\\nThis assumes you can tell the high potential people apart from everyone\\nelse. That too is lea as an exercise for the reader.\\nFiring\\nFirst, recognize the paradox of deciding to Fre an executive.\\nThe paradox works like this:\\nIt takes time to gather data to evaluate an executive\u2019s performance. You can\u2019t evaluate an executive based on her own output, like a normal employee \u2014 you have to evaluate her based\\non the output of her organization. It takes time for her to build\\nand manage her organization to generate output. Therefore, it\\n62 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\ntakes longer to evaluate the performance of an executive than a normal\\nemployee.\\nBut, an executive can cause far more damage than a normal\\nemployee. A normal employee doesn\u2019t work out, Xne, replace\\nhim. An executive doesn\u2019t work out, it can \u2014 worst case \u2014 permanently cripple her function and sometimes the entire company. Therefore, it is far more important to Fre a bad executive as fast\\nas possible, versus a normal employee.\\nSolution? There isn\u2019t one. It\u2019s a permanent problem.\\nI once asked Andy Grove, one of the world\u2019s all-time best CEOs,\\nabout this. He said, you always Xre a bad executive too late. If\\nyou\u2019re really good, you\u2019ll Xre her about three months too late.\\nBut you\u2019ll always do it too late. If you did it fast enough that it\\nwasn\u2019t too late, you wouldn\u2019t have enough data, and you\u2019d risk\\nbeing viewed as arbitrary and capricious by the rest of the organization.\\nSecond, the minute you have a bad feeling in your gut, start gathering\\ndata.\\nBack to the point on ruthlessly violating the chain of command\\n\u2014 get to it. Talk to everyone. Know what\u2019s going on. Unless\\nyou\u2019re paranoid \u2014 and, shockingly, I have met paranoid\\nfounders and CEOs, and not counting Andy Grove \u2014 you need\\nto gather the data because you\u2019re going to need to Xre the executive \u2014 if you\u2019re good, in about three months.\\nIn the meantime, of course do everything you can to coach and\\ndevelop and improve the executive. If it works out, that\u2019s great.\\nIf not, get ready.\\nA few speciXc things I think are critical to look for:\\n\u2022 Is the executive hiring?If there are open headcount slots and\\nnobody\u2019s coming in the door, you have a problem. Just as bad\\nis when the new hires aren\u2019t very good \u2014 when they\u2019re\\nbringing down the average quality of the organization.\\n\u2022 Is the executive training and developing her people?Oaen in a\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 63\\nstartup, an executive is hired to take over a function that\u2019s\\nalready been started, at least in rudimentary form. The\\npeople in that function should be noticeably better at their\\njobs, and highly respectful of the executive\u2019s skills, within the\\nXrst several months at the very least. If not, you have a\\nproblem.\\n\u2022 What do the other executives think?Great executives are oaen\\nimperfect but their peers always respect them. If your other\\nexecutives are skeptical of a new executive aaer the Xrst few\\nmonths, you have a problem.\\n\u2022 Is it painful for you to interact with the executive?Do you try to\\navoid or cancel your 1:1\u2019s? Does talking to her give you a\\nheadache? Do you oaen not understand what point she\u2019s\\ntrying to make or why she\u2019s focused on such an odd issue? If\\nthe answer to any of these questions is yes, you have a\\nproblem.\\nThird, Fre crisply.\\nFiring an executive sucks. It\u2019s disruptive to the organization. It\\ncreates a lot of work for you \u2014 not least of which is you\u2019ll have\\nto go Xnd someone else for the job. And, it risks making you\\nlook bad, since you\u2019re the one who hired the person in the Xrst\\nplace.\\nAnd it always seems to happen at a critical time in your startup\u2019s\\nlife, when the last thing you need is a distraction like this.\\nNevertheless, the only thing to do is do it, do it professionally,\\nmake clear to the organization what will happen next, and get\\non down the road.\\nIn my opinion the two most common mistakes people make\\nwhen they Xre executives both fall in the category of pulling\\none\u2019s punches, and I highly recommend avoiding them:\\n\u2022 Long transition periods \u2014 tempting, but counterproductive.\\nConfusing, demoralizing, and just plain weird. Instead, make\\na clean break, put a new person in charge \u2014 even if only on\\nan acting basis \u2014 and get moving.\\n64 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\n\u2022 Demotion as an alternative to Xring (or, alternately, \u201cI know,\\nwe\u2019ll hire her a boss!\u201d). Hate it. Great people don\u2019t deal well\\nwith getting demoted. There is an occasional exception.\\nUnless you are positive you have such an exception, skip it,\\nand move directly to the conclusion.\\nFourth, don\u2019t feel guilty.\\nYou\u2019re not beheading anyone.\\nAnyone who got a job as an executive at a startup is going to\\nhave an easy time getting the next job. Aaer all, she can always\\npaint you as a crazy founder, or inept CEO.\\nMore oaen than not, when you Xre an executive, you are doing\\nher a favor \u2014 you are giving her a chance to Xnd a better Xt\\nin a diWerent company where she will be more valued, more\\nrespected, and more successful. This sounds mushy, but I mean\\nit. And if she can\u2019t, then she has a much deeper problem and\\nyou just dodged a huge bullet.\\nAnd on that cheery note, good luck!\\nCounterpoint: Ben Horowitz on\\nmicromanagement\\n[This is a guest post from my business partner Ben Horowitz, reacting\\nto my recent post about hiring, managing, promoting, and Fring executives. I have italicized the parts where he really tears into me for your\\nadded humor value.]\\nWhile I enjoyed Marc\u2019s post on hiring and Xring executives, I\\nthink that he unfairly dissed micromanagement.\\nHere\u2019s why.\\nEveryone knows that the hyper-controlling manager with the\\nsevere personality disorder who micromanages every crummy\\ndecision is no fun to work for. However, it is wrong to condemn\\nthe practice of micromanagement on that basis.\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 65\\nSpeciXcally, there are times and situations where micromanaging executives is not just ok, but also the right thing to do.\\nAndy Grove has an excellent explanation of this in his classic\\nbook High Output Management, where he describes a concept\\ncalled \u201cTask Relevant Maturity\u201d. Andy explains that employees\\nwho are immature in a given task require detailed training and\\ninstruction. They need to be micromanaged. On the other\\nhand, if an employee is relatively mature in a task, then it is\\ncounterproductive and annoying to manage the details of their\\nwork.\\nThis is also true when managing executives. Marc might think\\nthat he hires an executive because she has the experience and\\nknow-how to comprehensively do her job, so any detailed\\ninstruction would be unwise and unwarranted. Marc would be\\nwrong about that. It turns out that even \u2014 and maybe especially\\n\u2014 executives are also immature in certain tasks.\\nIt is almost always the case that a new executive will be immature in their understanding of your market, your technology,\\nand your company \u2014 its personnel, processes, and culture. Will\\nthe new head of engineering at Ning walk in the door with\\nMarc\u2019s understanding of the development process or the technology base? Would it be better for this new head of engineering\\nto make guesses and use her own best \u2014 not so good\u2013 judgment, or for Marc to review the Xrst say 20 decisions until the\\nnew exec is fully up to speed?\\nIn reality \u2014 as opposed to Marc\u2019s warped view of reality \u2014 it will\\nbe extremely helpful for Marc [if he were actually the CEO,\\nwhich he is not] to meet with the new head of engineering daily\\nwhen she comes on board and review all of her thinking and\\ndecisions. This level of micromanagement will accelerate her\\ntraining and improve her long-term eWectiveness. It will make\\nher seem smarter to the rest of the organization which will build\\ncredibility and conXdence while she comes up to speed. Micromanaging new executives is generally a good idea for a limited\\nperiod of time.\\nHowever, that is not the only time that it makes sense to micro66 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nmanage executives. It turns out that just about every executive\\nin the world has a few things that are seriously wrong with\\nthem. They have areas where they are truly deXcient in judgment or skill set. That\u2019s just life. Almost nobody is brilliant\\nat everything. When hiring and when Hring executives, you\\nmust therefore focus on strength rather than lack of weakness. Everybody has severe weaknesses even if you can\u2019t see\\nthem yet. When managing, it\u2019s oaen useful to micromanage and\\nto provide remedial training around these weaknesses. Doing so\\nmay make the diWerence between an executive succeeding or\\nfailing.\\nFor example, you might have a brilliant engineering executive\\nwho generates excellent team loyalty, has terriXc product judgment and makes the trains run on time. This same executive\\nmay be very poor at relating to the other functions in the company. She may generate far more than her share of cross-functional conYicts, cut herself oW from critical information, and\\nsigniXcantly impede your ability to sell and market eWectively.\\nYour alternatives are:\\n(a) Macro-manage and give her an annual or quarterly objective\\nto Xx it, or\u2026\\n(b) Intensively micromanage her interactions until she learns\\nthe fundamental interpersonal skills required to be an eWective\\nexecutive.\\nI am arguing that doing (a) will likely result in weak performance. The reason is that she very likely has no idea how to be\\neWective with her peers. If somebody is an executive, it\u2019s very\\nlikely that somewhere along the line somebody gave her feedback \u2014 perhaps abstractly \u2014 about all of her weaknesses. Yet\\nthe weakness remains. As a result, executives generally require\\nmore hands-on management than lower level employees to\\nimprove weak areas.\\nSo, micromanagement is like Xne wine. A little at the right times\\nwill really enhance things; too much all the time and you\u2019ll end\\nup in rehab.\\nPart 8: Hiring, managing, promoting, and Dring executives 67\\nPart 9: How to hire a professional\\nCEO\\nDon\u2019t.\\nIf you don\u2019t have anyone on your founding team who is capable\\nof being CEO, then sell your company \u2014 now.\\nHow to hire the best people you\\'ve\\never worked with\\nThere are many aspects to hiring great people, and various people smarter than me have written extensively on the topic.\\nSo I\u2019m not going to try to be comprehensive.\\nBut I am going to relay some lessons learned through hard\\nexperience on how to hire the best people you\u2019ve ever worked\\nwith \u2014 particularly for a startup.\\nI\u2019m going to cover two key areas in this post:\\n\u2022 Criteria: what to value when evaluating candidates.\\n\u2022 And process: how to actually run the hiring process, and if\\nnecessary the aaermath of making a mistake.\\nCriteria 7rst\\nLots of people will tell you to hire for intelligence.\\nEspecially in this industry.\\nYou will read, hire the smartest people out there and your company\u2019s success is all but guaranteed.\\nI think intelligence, per se, is highly overrated.\\nSpeciXcally, I am unaware of any actual data that shows a cor-\\nrelation between raw intelligence, as measured by any of the\\nstandard metrics (educational achievement, intelligence tests, or\\nskill at solving logic puzzles) and company success.\\nNow, clearly you don\u2019t want to hire dumb people, and clearly\\nyou\u2019d like to work with smart people.\\nBut let\u2019s get speciXc.\\nMost of the lore in our industry about the role of intelligence\\nin company success comes from two stratospherically successful companies \u2014 Microsoa, and now Google \u2014 that are famous\\nfor hiring for intelligence.\\nMicrosoa\u2019s metric for intelligence was the ability to solve logic\\npuzzles.\\n(I don\u2019t know if the new, MBA-heavy Microsoa still does this,\\nbut I do know this is how Microsoa in its heyday worked.)\\nFor example, a classic Microsoa interview question was: \u201cWhy\\nis a manhole cover round?\u201d\\nThe right answer, of course, is, \u201cWho cares? Are we in the manhole business?\u201d\\n(Followed by twisting in your chair to look all around, getting\\nup, and leaving.)\\nGoogle, on the other hand, uses the metric of educational\\nachievement.\\nHave a PhD? Front of the line. Masters? Next. Bachelor\u2019s? Go to\\nthe end.\\nIn apparent direct contraction to decades of experience in the\\ncomputer industry that PhD\u2019s are the hardest people to motivate to ship commercially viable products \u2014 with rare exception.

Hi, Diego!)\\nNow, on the one hand, you can\u2019t question the level of success of\\neither company.\\n70 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nMaybe they\u2019re right.\\nBut maybe, just maybe, their success had a lot to do with other\\nfactors \u2014 say, huge markets, extreme aggressiveness, right time/\\nright place, key distribution deals, and at least in one case, great\\nproducts.\\nBecause here\u2019s the problem: I\u2019m not aware of another Microsoa\\nthat\u2019s been built by hiring based on logic puzzles. And I\u2019m not\\naware of another Google that\u2019s been built by hiring PhD\u2019s.\\nSo maybe there are other hiring criteria that are equally, or\\nmore, important.\\nHere\u2019s what I think those criteria are.\\nDrive\\nI deXne drive as self-motivation \u2014 people who will walk right\\nthrough brick walls, on their own power, without having to be\\nasked, to achieve whatever goal is in front of them.\\nPeople with drive push and push and push and push and push\\nuntil they succeed.\\nWinston Churchill aaer the evacuation of Dunkirk:\\n\u201cWe shall not Yag or fail.

That may or may not be the\\nsame thing as being driven to succeed in the real world.)\\nDrive is even independent of prior career success.\\nDriven people don\u2019t tend to stay long at places where they can\u2019t\\nsucceed, and just because they haven\u2019t succeeded in the wrong\\ncompanies doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t succeed at your company\\n\u2014 if they\u2019re driven.\\nI think you can see drive in a candidate\u2019s eyes, and in a candidate\u2019s background.\\nFor the background part, I like to see what someone has done.\\nNot been involved in, or been part of, or watched happen, or\\nwas hanging around when it happened.\\nI look for something you\u2019ve done, either in a job or (oaen better\\nyet) outside of a job.\\nThe business you started and ran in high school.\\nThe nonproXt you started and ran in college.\\nIf you\u2019re a programmer: the open source project to which\\nyou\u2019ve made major contributions.\\nSomething.\\nIf you can\u2019t Xnd anything \u2014 if a candidate has just followed the\\n72 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nrules their whole lives, showed up for the right classes and the\\nright tests and the right career opportunities without achieving\\nsomething distinct and notable, relative to their starting point \u2014\\nthen they probably aren\u2019t driven.\\nAnd you\u2019re not going to change them.\\nMotivating people who are fundamentally unmotivated is not\\neasy.\\nBut motivating people who are self-motivated is wind at your\\nback.\\nI like speciXcally looking for someone for which this job is their\\nbig chance to really succeed.\\nFor this reason, I like hiring people who haven\u2019t done the speciXc job before, but are determined to ace it regardless.\\nI also like speciXcally looking for someone who comes from\\nsome kind of challenging background \u2014 a diZcult family situation, say, or someone who had to work his/her way through\\nschool \u2014 who is nevertheless on par with his/her more fortunate peers in skills and knowledge.\\nFinally, beware in particular people who have been at highly\\nsuccessful companies.\\nPeople used to say, back when IBM owned the industry: never\\nhire someone straight out of IBM. First, let them go somewhere\\nelse and fail. Then, once they\u2019ve realized the real world is not\\nlike IBM, hire them and they\u2019ll be great.\\nAnd remember, an awful lot of people who have been at hugely\\nsuccessful companies were just along for the ride.\\nCareer success is great to look for \u2014 but it\u2019s critical to verify that\\nthe candidates out of hugely successful companies actually did\\nwhat they claim in their roles at those companies.

Tell Wall Street that your predecessor\\nwas such an incredibly dim bulb that in retrospect you can\u2019t\\neven understand how he got past security and into the building,\\nmuch less was picked to be CEO. He completely fouled the\\nXnancials and sabotaged the business and as a result, earnings\\nfor the next several quarters are going to come in way below\\nexpectations.\\nThe fun part about this one is that your stock won\u2019t even drop\\nbecause everyone has already Xgured that out.\\nStep 3: Identify the 3-5 things that are working surprisingly well in\\nyour business, and double down on those.\\nAny big company, no matter how moribund and poorly run, has\\na number of products and projects that are going better than\\nexpected \u2014 and usually come as a complete surprise.\\nDrawing on Peter Drucker\u2019s classic admonition to \u201cfocus on\\nopportunities, not problems\u201d, Xgure out what these surprise successes are and double down on them.\\nPromote their general managers, elevate their business units in\\nthe organization, give them more funding, and get out of the\\nway.\\nStep 4: Identify the 3-5 things that are consuming a lot of money and\\ntime and yet going nowhere, and kill those.\\nA good starting point is your predecessor\u2019s pet projects \u2014 line\\n\u2018em up and shoot \u2018em.\\nFrankly, they don\u2019t even have to be consuming that much\\nmoney.

Nuke as many of them as you can.\\nThen develop a list of your top 20 or 30 up and comers \u2014\\nstrong, sharp, aggressive, ambitious director- or VP-level managers who want to succeed and want your company to succeed.\\nAnd promote them, and put them in sole charge of clearly identiXed teams and missions. (And give them big ol\u2019 fresh option\\npackages.)\\nAs CEO, you should only have at most one executive between\\nyou and these 20 or 30 up and comers once you are done promoting them and putting them in charge of their teams and\\nmissions.\\nIf you don\u2019t know who those top 20 or 30 up and comers are, if\\nyou don\u2019t promote them, if you don\u2019t put them clearly in charge\\nof the things that matter, or if you have more than one layer of\\n84 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nmanagement between you and them when you\u2019re done, you\u2019re\\nprobably doomed.\\nStep 7: Figure out the single most important thing your company has\\nto win at, and put your single best person in charge of winning at it.\\n\u2018NuW said.\\nStep 8: Look at the market, Fgure out 3-5 new areas in which your\\ncompany is not currently playing or winning, but are clearly going to\\ngrow a lot \u2014 and acquire the best company in each of those areas.\\nHere you\u2019re looking for growth \u2014 for products, trends, perhaps\\nphenomena outside but adjacent to your current products and\\nmarkets, that are going to grow a lot in the next few years.\\nYou have to acquire, because if you\u2019re in a turnaround situation,\\nyou aren\u2019t going to have the time or bandwidth to build them\\nin-house \u2014 unless you\u2019re the very rare exception.\\nWhen you do acquire, you\u2019re going to have to pay up, because\\nnew things that are growing really fast in growth markets are\\nalways expensive \u2014 whether private or public \u2014 especially\\ncompared to the PE multiple of a big company in turnaround.\\nSo here\u2019s hoping you did a great job at Step 5.\\nStep 9: In six months, relaunch the company with a single, crisp,\\ncoherent message and strategy.\\nThen go dark again and go right back to work.\\nOf course, there\u2019s more to being the CEO of a turnaround than\\nthese 9 steps.

This post isn\u2019t really about retention at all.\\nIt\u2019s about winning.\\nLet me explain:\\nCompanies that are winning \u2014 even really big, old ones \u2014 never\\nhave a retention problem. Everyone wants to stay, and when someone does leave, it\u2019s really easy to get someone great to take her\\nplace.\\nCompanies that have a retention problem usually have a winning problem. Or rather, a \u201cnot winning\u201d problem.\\nThe typical case is a company that used to be a hot growth company, but the growth has Yattened out, causing the stock to tank\\nand everyone to be in a bad mood. Or, alternately, an older\\nbig company that did really well for a while but more recently\\nhasn\u2019t been doing so well, causing the stock to tank and everyone to be in a bad mood.\\nIn other words, a company in transition \u2014 from winning at one\\npoint, to not winning now.\\nThe only way a company in that situation can retain great people is to start winning again.\\nGreat people want to work at a winner.\\nAll the raises, perks, and HR-sponsored \u201ccompany values\u201d draaing sessions in the world won\u2019t help you retain great people if\\nyou\u2019re not winning \u2014 not even the $6,000 heated Japanese toilets in all the restrooms, the $30,000 Olympic lap pool out back,\\nand the free $4 bottles of organic orange juice in all the snack\\nrooms.\\nThis seems deeply unfair when you\u2019re going through it, because\\nwhen you\u2019re not winning, that\u2019s exactly when you need all those\\ngreat people the most!\\nOh well. That\u2019s the price we pay for living in a society where\\njobs aren\u2019t for life anymore.\\nSo the right question is, how can we start\\nwinning again?\\nIn this post, I\u2019m going to punt on large parts of the answer to\\nthat question, as follows:\\n\u2022 I already discussed the big company turnaround scenarioin\\nmy last post in this series, which describes how to take a big\\ncompany that is no longer winning and set it up to win again.\\n\u2022 A company that was a hot startup a few years ago and grew\\nfast but is now seeing growth slow has a slightly diWerent\\nproblem \u2014 your original product cycle has peaked and you\\nneed to Xnd a new product cycle. That\u2019s your big challenge,\\nway beyond retention. But I\u2019ll talk about that in a future post.\\nRetention follows from the steps you are taking to orchestrate\\nthe turnaround and/or get to the next big product cycle.\\nHaving adroitly sidestepped most of what you need to do, let\\nme now address some things you can do to help the retention\\nPart 2: Retaining great people 87\\nsituation while you are addressing the deeper issues required to\\nwin again.\\nFirst, don\u2019t give up. I am particularly talking about the former hot\\nstartup that is now a large slow-growth company. It is easy to\\nsay, well, we\u2019re not a startup anymore, we\u2019re not a growth company anymore \u2014 now we\u2019re a big company, and we need to\\nchange our culture and our methods to attract and retain the\\nkinds of people who like to work at big companies.\\nDoing that will make your situation far worse, by causing the\\nremaining great people you do have to abandon ship even\\nfaster. Who wants to work for a company that has given up on\\nhaving energy and drive and ambition? And then you will end\\nup with a staW that only knows how to be a big company \u2014\\nthat only knows how to maintain something that someone else\\nhas already built \u2014 which is death in any industry where things\\nchange all the time.\\nSecond, focus. In a technology company, focus on retaining the\\ngreat architects and managers. In other kinds of companies,\\nfocus on retaining the equivalent people \u2014 the people who are\\nthe magnets for retaining other great people and hiring more\\ngreat people.\\nYou have to retain the magnets \u2014 or at least a critical mass of\\nthem \u2014 because without them, you\u2019re going to lose everyone\\nelse.\\nIf you bear down and focus on retaining the magnets, retaining\\neveryone else \u2014 for example, in a soaware company, the junior\\nprogrammers, the product managers, the user interface designers, the salespeople, the sales engineers, the marketing staW, and\\nso on \u2014 will be much easier.\\nThird, clean house. Any company with a retention problem probably also has an overstaZng problem and a mediocrity problem\\nand needs to Xx both of those at the same time.\\nIdentify and eliminate the jobs of the following categories of\\npeople:\\n88 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\n\u2022 People who are \u201cvesting in peace\u201d \u2014 so called \u201cVIPs\u201d. VIPs are\\na particular problem at the former hot startup that has\\nplateaued. They suck the life out of their environment and\\nhave to go.\\n\u2022 \u201cSummertime soldiers\u201d \u2014 people who only joined in the Xrst\\nplace because you were already successful and have no\\ninterest in really bearing down and applying themselves to a\\nchallenge. Again, a classic problem for the former hot\\nstartup. Look particularly hard at the people who joined in\\nthe two years following the IPO \u2014 some of them are\\nundoubtedly very hard working, but others are summertime\\nsoldiers and have to go.\\n\u2022 Mediocre performers \u2014 every company has some, unless\\nyou have been routinely Xring your bottom 10% every year,\\nand even then you probably have some.\\nTaking out the people who fall into these categories will make\\nyour remaining great people feel better immediately, and will\\nsave you a lot of money and stock options that you can reallocate to better purposes \u2014 such as new compensation packages\\nfor your remaining great people.\\nFourth, promote your best people \u2014 especially into the jobs vacated\\nby the more senior of the people you just Xred \u2014 and give them\\nvery interesting challenges.\\nThat is so fundamental that I\u2019m not even going to discuss it further here.\\nFiMh, simplify and clarify your organizational structure to make sure\\nthat your best people have direct responsibility for their projects.\\nCompanies coming oW a period of signiXcant success usually\\nhave grown a lot and/or bought a lot of other companies, and\\ntypically have messy or overly complex org structures. This is a\\ngreat opportunity to clean that up \u2014 and in particular, to move\\nto an organizational model where each of your stars has clear,\\ndirect, and comprehensive responsibility for a critical mission.\\nPart 2: Retaining great people 89\\nNuke all matrices. Nuke all dual reporting structures. And nuke\\nas many shared services functions as you possibly can.\\nFor example, in a soaware company, break up the centralized\\ndocumentation group, QA group, build group, etc. and disperse\\nthose people into the individual product divisions. Give your\\nproduct division heads complete responsibility for everything\\nthey need to ship great products \u2014 except for sales. And then in\\nsales, give your territory heads everything they need to kill their\\nnumbers.\\nA great general rule of thumb for this kind of organizational\\nredesign is that you want to tolerate overlap. So each product\\ndivision has its own QA team \u2014 so what? Your division heads \u2014\\nwho are now your best people \u2014 will be able to move so much\\nfaster that way that it\u2019s worth it. Plus, you saved so much money\\ntaking out the VIPs, summertime soldiers, and mediocre people\\nthat you\u2019re still ahead on headcount expense.\\nRemember, it\u2019s generally a good idea, once you do all of this\\nrestructuring, to end up with smaller team sizes than you had\\nbefore. By reducing the size of a team, and increasing the average quality level within the team, you will usually speed things\\nup, while saving money.\\nFinally, be sure to take out layers \u2014 especially at the top of the\\ncompany. The best people who are now running all the key projects and divisions should be no more than one layer away from\\nthe CEO, and usually that means you can take out at least one\\nlayer, maybe two, and (shudder) maybe even more.\\nSixth, put the recruiters to work, aggressively \u2014 but don\u2019t rely on them\\nfor everything.\\nNotably, for the really critical open jobs, go out and recruit the\\nright person yourself, or better yet promote from within.\\nAnd here\u2019s a neat trick that actually works. Go out and re-recruit\\nthe best people who already lea. Some of them have since\\ndiscovered that the grass isn\u2019t actually greener at whatever\\nmediocre startup they joined or whatever other big company\\n90 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nthey jumped to. Give them fat packages against the new mission\\nand get them back.\\nSeventh, ramp up college recruiting. This will be very important for\\nyou over the next couple years. College recruiting is the best\\nway to get a bunch of new Xred up people into your company\\nwho are hungry and who don\u2019t realize quite how badly you suck.\\n(That was a joke.)\\nEighth, communicate within \u2014 tell everyone in your company\\nclearly and unambiguously, we are here to win and here\u2019s how\\nwe\u2019re going to do it. It won\u2019t be easy, but we can do it and we will do\\nit, and we will have amazing stories to tell our grandchildren.\\nYou don\u2019t need to be certain of all the answers! Colin Powell\\nsays, \u201cYou know you\u2019re a good leader when people follow you, if\\nonly out of curiosity.\u201d So project boldness, and have that glint in\\nyour eye where people know you\u2019re up to something big.\\nNinth, shake things up. Directly on Powell\u2019s curiosity point \u2014\\nchange the story to something new. Overhaul the organization,\\nmove people around, Xre people, promote other people, cancel\\nproducts, double down on other products, do some acquisitions,\\ncut some big deals, do some spinoWs, whatever \u2014 but change\\nthe story. Reintroduce curiosity.\\nWhen all else fails, do a \u201cshake and bake\u201d \u2014 do a big transformative deal that you\u2019re not sure will work but which you think\\nhas a real shot. That will at the very least inject energy back into\\nthe situation.\\nI am being deliberately cavalier about this tactic, especially the\\n\u201cshake and bake\u201d part. You can easily destroy your company\\nwith this kind of move.\\nBut \u2014 and this is a very important but \u2014 a company in crisis\\noaen has a severe narrative or \u201cstory\u201d problem that accompanies its business problems, and it can be hard to get people\\ninside and outside the company motivated to reengage without\\nyou forcing a dramatic change to the story in some fundamental\\nway.\\nPart 2: Retaining great people 91\\nStories don\u2019t change by themselves. Change the story.\\nNext topic: how to talk a great person out\\nof going to a startup\\nI\u2019m assuming based on all of the above that if you do the blocking and tackling right, you\u2019re going to be able to convince a lot\\nof your great people to not go to a diWerent big company.\\nTalking someone out of going to a startup is a separate challenge.\\nSomeone usually wants to move from a big company to a\\nstartup for one or more of the following four reasons:\\nFirst, she wants to build a new company instead of being a caretaker in\\nsomeone else\u2019s company.\\nYou can talk someone out of this if you can show her how, if\\nshe stays with you for two more years, you are going to concretely better train and prepare her to kick butt at a startup when\\nshe does make such a move \u2014 particularly if she is on the management track.\\nGive her a promotion, a big new job with a big new challenge,\\nand clear responsibility. And tell her that if she kicks butt at this\\nmore signiXcant challenge, she\u2019ll not only be better prepared to\\nbe out on her own, but you will personally give her glowing recommendations and help her Xnd the perfect startup or the perfect VC for her \u2014 in two years.\\nThen, two years later, you can do the same thing again.\\nI believe you are doing someone a huge favor when you do this.\\nMost startups aren\u2019t very good and have no prospect of real success, and most big company people aren\u2019t very good at picking\\n\u2018em, although they never believe that. And by staying, your great\\nperson is gaining incredibly valuable experience by taking on\\nnew challenges and new responsibilities at your company that\\nwill help her succeed and Yourish down the road wherever she\\nultimately decides to go.\\n92 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nIt\u2019s not that unusual to see a young superstar division head or\\nsenior vice president at a big company who has been promoted\\nrapidly over the last several years who has also been periodically\\non the verge of going to a startup and stayed each time for a new\\nchallenge instead. And there she is, running 100 or 500 or 2,000\\npeople and doing incredibly well in her career. Win/win.\\nNow, if you\u2019re not willing to promote \u2018em, that\u2019s another story.\\nSecond, she has a killer idea for a startup, or has fallen in love with a\\nstartup\u2019s killer idea.\\nIn this case, you\u2019re probably better oW letting her go to the\\nstartup.\\nThis isn\u2019t the case nearly as oaen as you\u2019d think. Some of the\\nstartups I\u2019ve seen great people join \u2014 including very recently \u2014\\nboggle my brain at how bad the ideas were.\\nThird, she wants the Fnancial upside of a startup.\\nVisions of being the next Larry Page (Larriett Page?) are dancing\\nin her head.\\nYou can oaen defeat this by simply explaining the realities of\\nthe compensation package she\u2019s being oWered.\\nExplain to her how her options will likely be worthless when\\nthe startup fails, how small a percentage of the company she\u2019s\\nactually being oWered, how much she\u2019s going to be diluted by\\nfuture Xnancing rounds, how far below market her package is\\noverall, and how bad the medical and dental beneXts are for her\\nkids. And if she hasn\u2019t changed her mind by that point, tell her a\\ncramdown round story.\\nFourth, she can\u2019t function in a large environment. It\u2019s too frustrating,\\ntoo boring, too many rules, too much management, whatever.\\nIn this case, you are probably also better oW letting her go to the\\nstartup.\\nThings not to do when trying to retain great people:\\nPart 2: Retaining great people 93\\nNow we\u2019re getting into personal opinion, but for what it\u2019s\\nworth\u2026\\nDon\u2019t create a new group or organization within your company whose\\njob is \u201cinnovation\u201d. This takes various forms, but it happens reasonably oaen when a big company gets into product trouble,\\nand it\u2019s hugely damaging.\\nHere\u2019s why:\\nFirst, you send the terrible message to the rest of the organization that they\u2019re not supposed to innovate.\\nSecond, you send the terrible message to the rest of the organization that you think they\u2019re the B team.\\nThat\u2019s a one-two punch that will seriously screw things up.\\nInstead, focus on boosting the innovation culture of the entire\\ncompany.\\nDon\u2019t do arbitrary large spot bonuses or restricted stock grants to try to\\ngive a small number of people huge Fnancial upside.\\nAn example is the Google Founders\u2019 Awards program, which\\nGoogle has largely stopped, and which didn\u2019t work anyway.\\nIt sounds like a great idea at the time, but it causes a severe\\nbacklash among both the normal people who don\u2019t get it (who\\nfeel like they\u2019re the B team) and the great people who don\u2019t get it\\n(who feel like they\u2019ve been screwed).\\nClosing thought\\nIn general, the intangibles that keep great people are: the quality\\nof the people they\u2019re working with, the interestingness level of\\ntheir projects, and whether they are learning and growing.\\nThe tangibles are: winning, and a high stock price.\\nAs the leader, you have to really believe that you can get your company back to winning andtherefore back to ahighstockprice.\\n94 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nIf not, you should sell the company.\\nPart 2: Retaining great people 95\\nThe Pmarca Guide to\\nCareer, Productivity, and\\nSome Other Things\\nIntroduction\\nIn real life \u2014 as opposed to blogging \u2014 one of my least favorite\\nthings to do is give career planning advice. Most people who\\nsay they want career planning advice aren\u2019t actually looking for\\nadvice \u2014 they just want validation of the path they have already\\nchosen. Because of that, giving someone career planning advice\\nis one of the surest ways to end up feeling like an a******.\\nHowever, as with so many other things, career planning is a\\ntopic about which I have plenty of opinions. And since I started\\nthis blog, I\u2019ve received a lot of questions from people who are\\nlooking for career planning advice. So, this series of posts will\\npresent my opinions on career planning in today\u2019s world.\\nDisclaimers:\\n\u2022 These posts are aimed at high-potential people who want to\\nexcel throughout their careers and make a signiXcant impact\\non their Xelds and the world. These posts are not appropriate\\nfor people for whom work/life balance is a high priority or\\nfor whom lifestyle is particularly important \u2014 if that\u2019s you,\\nthere are plenty of existing career planning resources for you\\nalready!\\n\u2022 My background is biased towards high-tech companies and\\nSilicon Valley, and my advice will be most relevant to people\\nentering either my industry or other industries that are like\\nmy industry \u2014 fast moving, rapidly changing, and\\ncharacterized by lots of new companies and lots of\\nopportunity for new people. Some of this advice may be\\napplicable to people entering other kinds of Xelds \u2014 but I\\nwouldn\u2019t know and I won\u2019t guarantee it.\\n\u2022 I\u2019ll use a lot of words like \u201cambition\u201d and \u201cpromotion\u201d and\\n\u201cgaining more responsibility\u201d. It may seem like I\u2019m talking\\nabout moving up through the management ranks and\\nmanaging more and more people, but my intention is for all\\nof this advice to be equally relevant to people in purely\\ntechnical careers, such as soaware programming. If you\\naren\u2019t interesting in managing people, then when I talk about\\npromotion and advancement, just think about getting\\nbroader latitude to work on or lead more complex technical\\nprojects, assuming more technical seniority within a\\ncompany, and the like.\\n\u2022 Everything that follows is purely personal opinion \u2014\\nspeciXcally, these are the things I would want to know if I\\nwere entering college today. I\u2019m sure there are many equally\\nvalid counterpoints to each of my points, and I look forward\\nto reading them on other people\u2019s blogs!\\n98 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nPart 1: Opportunity\\nThe Hrst rule of career planning: Do not plan your career.\\nThe world is an incredibly complex place and everything is\\nchanging all the time. You can\u2019t plan your career because you have\\nno idea what\u2019s going to happen in the future. You have no idea what\\nindustries you\u2019ll enter, what companies you\u2019ll work for, what\\nroles you\u2019ll have, where you\u2019ll live, or what you will ultimately\\ncontribute to the world. You\u2019ll change, industries will change,\\nthe world will change, and you can\u2019t possibly predict any of it.\\nTrying to plan your career is an exercise in futility that will only\\nserve to frustrate you, and to blind you to the really signiXcant\\nopportunities that life will throw your way.\\nCareer planning = career limiting.\\nThe sooner you come to grips with that, the better.\\nThe second rule of career planning: Instead of planning your\\ncareer, focus on developing skills and pursuing opportunities.\\nI\u2019ll talk a lot about skills development in the next post. But for\\nthe rest of this post, I\u2019m going to focus in on the nature of opportunities.\\nOpportunities are key. I would argue that opportunities fall loosely\\ninto two buckets: those that present themselves to you, and\\nthose that you go out and create. Both will be hugely important\\nto your career.\\nOpportunities that present themselves to you are the consequence \u2014 at least partially \u2014 of being in the right place at the\\nright time. They tend to present themselves when you\u2019re not\\nexpecting it \u2014 and oaen when you are engaged in other activities\\nthat would seem to preclude you from pursuing them. And\\nthey come and go quickly \u2014 if you don\u2019t jump all over an opportunity, someone else generally will and it will vanish.\\nI believe a huge part of what people would like to refer to as\\n\u201ccareer planning\u201d is being continuously alert to opportunities\\nthat present themselves to you spontaneously, when you happen to be in the right place at the right time.\\n\u2022 A senior person at your Xrm is looking for someone young\\nand hungry to do the legwork on an important project, in\\naddition to your day job.\\n\u2022 Your former manager has jumped ship to a hot growth\\ncompany and calls you three months later and says, come\\njoin me.\\n\u2022 Or, a small group of your smartest friends are headed to\\nDenny\u2019s at 11PM to discuss an idea for a startup \u2014 would you\\nlike to come along?\\nI am continually amazed at the number of people who are presented with an opportunity like one of the above, and pass.\\nThere\u2019s your basic dividing line between the people who shoot up in\\ntheir careers like a rocket ship, and those who don\u2019t \u2014 right there.\\nThe second bucket of opportunities are those you seek out and\\ncreate. A lot of what will follow in future posts in this series\\nwill discuss how to do that. However, let me say up front that I\\nam also continually amazed at the number of people who coast\\nthrough life and don\u2019t go and seek out opportunities even when\\nthey know in their gut what they\u2019d really like to do. Don\u2019t be one\\nof those people. Life is way too short.\\nThe world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want,\\nand you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion,\\n100 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nthe world will oaen reconXgure itself around you much more\\nquickly and easily than you would think.\\nNow, I\u2019m not proposing that you simply ping pong from\\nopportunity to opportunity randomly. You can have a strategy.\\nAnd here\u2019s how I think that strategy should work.\\nPeople who manage money professionally don\u2019t think about\\nindividual investments in isolation; they think of those investments as part of an overall portfolio. Each investment has its\\npotential return \u2014 the beneXt you get from owning it \u2014 and its\\npotential risks \u2014 the things that can go wrong. A portfolio, then,\\nis a set of investments, and the portfolio assumes the return and\\nrisk characteristics of all of the investments blended together.\\nViewed in that context, it is oaen logical to have individual\\ninvestments within a portfolio that are far more risky than one\\nwould normally Xnd comfortable \u2014 if the potential return is\\ngood enough. Or, investments that are far less risky and have far\\nless return potential than one would normally want \u2014 to protect one\u2019s downside. The risk of any individual investment is not\\nimportant; what is important is how the risks \u2014 and the potential returns \u2014 of all of the investments combine in the overall\\nportfolio.\\nI believe you should look at your career as a portfolio of jobs/\\nroles/opportunities. Each job that you take, each role that you\\nchoose to Xll, each opportunity you pursue, will have a certain\\npotential return \u2014 the beneXts you can get from taking it,\\nwhether those beneXts come in the form of income, skill development, experience, geographic location, or something else.\\nEach job will also have a certain risk proXle \u2014 the things that\\ncould go wrong, from getting Xred for not being able to handle\\nthe job\u2019s demands, to having to move somewhere you don\u2019t\\nwant to, to the company going bankrupt, to the opportunity cost\\nof not pursuing some other attractive opportunity.\\nOnce you start thinking this way, you can think strategically\\nabout your career over its likely 50+ year timespan.\\nFor example, when you are just out of school and have a low\\nPart 1: Opportunity 101\\nburn rate and geographic Yexibility, you can take jobs with a\\ncertain return/risk proXle. If you get married and have kids, you\\nwill take jobs with a diWerent return/risk proXle. Later, when\\nyour kids grow up and you are once again free to move about\\nand you don\u2019t have to worry about tuition payments and a\\nmortgage on a big house in a great school district, but you now\\nhave far more experience than you did when you were Xrst\\nstarting out, you can take jobs with a third return/risk proXle.\\nMost people do not think this way. They might occasionally\\nthink this way, but they don\u2019t do it systematically. So when\\nan opportunity pops up, they evaluate it on a standalone basis\\n\u2014 \u201cboy, it looks risky, I\u2019m not sure I should do it\u201d. What you\\nshould automatically do instead is put it in context with all of\\nthe other risks you are likely to take throughout your entire\\ncareer and decide whether this new opportunity Fts strategically into\\nyour portfolio.\\nLet\u2019s dig into the concept of risk a little more.\\nI\u2019m not talking about the form of risk that you think of when\\nyou think of stepping out into the crosswalk and getting run\\nover by an Escalade. I\u2019m talking about the form of risk that\\nXnancial professionals deal with (see the classic book Against\\nthe Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk for more on this), and\\nstartup entrepreneurs deal with, and that you deal with any time\\nyou make any decision. There are a set of potential downsides to\\nalmost any decision \u2014 but they can be analyzed, and oMen quantiFed,\\nand thereby brought under control.\\nWhich is important, because in life, there is generally no opportunity\\nwithout risk. Doing the legwork on that extra project for the\\nsenior person at your Xrm? You risk exhausting yourself and\\ndoing your day job poorly. Joining your former manager at\\nthat hot growth company? Maybe it tanks six months later and\\nthen your current employer won\u2019t rehire you. Join those smart\\nfriends at Denny\u2019s and start a new company with them? Maybe\\nit completely fails, and you have to explain why you were so\\nfoolish at every job interview you do for the rest of your\\n102 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nlife. There are always real and legitimate reasons why people oMen pass\\non opportunities \u2014 they see the risks and they wish to avoid them.\\nThe issue is that without taking risk, you can\u2019t exploit any\\nopportunities. You can live a quiet and reasonably happy life,\\nbut you are unlikely to create something new, and you are\\nunlikely to make your mark on the world.\\nTo quote Aaron Brown \u2014 a legendary Morgan Stanley derivatives trader and poker expert \u2014 from his extraordinary\\nbook The Poker Face of Wall Street, when talking about hiring\\ntraders at an investment bank:\\nWhat I listen for is someone who really wanted something that\\ncould be obtained only through taking the risk, whether that risk\\nwas big or small.\\nIt\u2019s not even important that she managed the risk skillfully; it\u2019s only\\nimportant that she knew it was there, respected it, but took it anyway.\\nMost people wander through life, carelessly taking whatever risk\\ncrosses their path without compensation, but never consciously\\naccepting extra risk to pick up the money and other good things\\nlying all around them.\\nOther people reYexively avoid every risk or grab every loose dollar\\nwithout caution.\\nI don\u2019t mean to belittle these strategies; I\u2019m sure they make sense to\\nthe people who pursue them. I just don\u2019t understand them myself.\\nI do know that none of these people will be successful traders.\\n\u2026or successful at anything important in life.\\nSo, when you are presented with an opportunity, carefully\\nanalyze its risks, but:\\n\u2022 Do so within the context if your likely lifetime portfolio of\\nrisks\u2026\\n\u2022 And do so realizing that taking risk can be a good thing when\\nit leads to pursuing the best opportunities.\\nPart 1: Opportunity 103\\nAll that said, here are some of my opinions about the kinds of\\nrisks you should take and when:\\n\u2022 When you are just out of school \u2014 and assuming that you are\\nrelatively free to move and have a low burn rate \u2014 is when\\nyou should optimize for the rate at which you can develop\\nskills and acquire experiences that will serve you well later.\\nYou should speciXcally take income risk in order to do that.\\nAlways take the job that will best develop your skills and give\\nyou valuable experiences, regardless of its salary. This is not\\nthe time in your career to play it safe.\\n\u2022 When you have family obligations \u2014 a spouse, two and a half\\nkids, a dog, and a picket fence \u2014 that\u2019s obviously the time to\\ncrank back on the income risk and instead take a little risk\\nthat you might not learn as much or advance as quickly or\\njoin that hot new startup. However, even this is not black and\\nwhite! In Silicon Valley, for example, it can still make a lot of\\nsense for a young parent to take a risk on a hot new startup\\nbecause it will usually be easy to get another job if the startup\\nfails \u2014 especially if one has developed more useful skills and\\nexperiences along the way.\\n\u2022 There may be times when you realize that you are\\ndissatisXed with your Xeld \u2014 you are working in enterprise\\nsoaware, for example, but you\u2019d really rather be working on\\ngreen tech or in a consumer Internet company. Jumping\\nfrom one Xeld into another is always risky because your\\nspeciXc skills and contacts are in your old Xeld, so you\u2019ll have\\nless certainty of success in the new Xeld. This is almost always a\\nrisk worth taking\u2013 standing pat and being unhappy about it\\nhas risks of its own, particularly to your happiness. And it is\\nawfully hard to be highly successful in a job or Xeld in which\\none is unhappy.\\n\u2022 Likewise with geography risk. You start out in one city \u2014 say,\\nworking at a soaware company in Philadelphia \u2014 and you\u2019re\\ndoing well. You get the opportunity to jump to a faster\\ngrowing soaware company in Silicon Valley. Should you take\\nthe risk of moving geographies \u2014 to a place where you don\u2019t\\nknow anybody, and where the cost of living is higher? Almost\\n104 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\ncertainly \u2014 the additional risks of not having an extensive\\npersonal network and of tolerating a lower standard of living\\nfor some period of time are almost certainly overcome by\\nthe upside of being at a better company, relocating yourself\\nto the heart of your industry, and setting yourself up to\\nexploit many more great opportunities over the next\\ndecades.\\n\u2022 Working for a big company is, I believe, much risker than it\\nlooks. I\u2019ll talk about this more in the next post, but people\\nwho work at big companies are subject to impersonal layoWs\\nat any time, and oaen forego the opportunity to develop\\nskills and gain experiences as rapidly as they would at\\nsomeplace smaller and faster growing. And then Xve or ten\\nyears pass, and you realize your skills and experiences are\\nonly relevant for jobs at other big companies \u2014 and then you\\nhave a real problem.\\n\u2022 Finally, pay attention to opportunity cost at all times. Doing\\none thing means not doing other things. This is a form of risk\\nthat is very easy to ignore, to your detriment.\\nThose are just a few examples. You will run into speciXc return/\\nrisk situations that nobody can predict ahead of time. When you\\ndo, just sit down and tease apart the risks \u2014 and think hard about\\nwhether, in the context of your overall career portfolio, they are\\nreally so scary that they justify passing on the return potential\\nof a great opportunity. They oaen won\u2019t.\\nOne more quote, this time from Nassim Nicholas Taleb in The\\nBlack Swan:\\nSeize any opportunity, or anything that looks like opportunity. They are rare, much rarer than you think\u2026\\nMany people do not realize they are getting a lucky break in life\\nwhen they get it. If a big publisher (or a big art dealer or a movie\\nexecutive or a hotshot banker or a big thinker) suggests an appointment, cancel anything you have planned: you may not see such a\\nwindow open up again.\\nOf course, if you really are high-potential, you\u2019re naturally\\ngoing to be seeking out risks in your career in order to maxPart 1: Opportunity 105\\nimize your level of achievement, so you\u2019re thinking, c\u2019mon,\\nAndreessen, get to the next point.

Note especially that these\\nare only personal views; I am not trying to malign anyone else\u2019s\\nchoice of career or education path. These are simply the\\nthings I would want to be told if I were entering college today.]\\nThis post discusses skills acquisition throughout your lifetime,\\nincluding your formal education. So I will start with college and\\nmove on from there.\\nWhat should I study in college?\\nSome people argue that college will be your one chance in life\\nto pursue your passion \u2014 to spend four years doing nothing but\\nstudying whatever you love the most, whether that\u2019s Renaissance literature or existential philosophy.\\nI disagree.\\nIf you intend to have an impact on the world, the faster you start\\ndeveloping concrete skills that will be useful in the real world, the\\nbetter \u2014 and your undergrad degree is a great place to start.\\nOnce you get into the real world and you\u2019re primed for success, then you can pursue your passion.\\nA typical liberal arts degree will be almost useless on its own. So\\nyou usually won\u2019t have the option of immediately entering the\\nworkforce in a high-impact way when you graduate, and you\u2019ll\\nhave to go get a useful graduate degree.\\nAnd even if you are already planning to get a useful graduate\\ndegree, you are much better oW combining it with a substantive\\nundergraduate degree \u2014 thereby becoming a \u201cdouble threat\u201d.\\nMore on this in a bit.\\nWhich undergraduate degrees are useful in\\nthe real world?\\nTypically, those that have a technical element of some form \u2014\\nthat teach you how to do something substantive.\\nEngineering degrees obviously qualify. The current myth that\\nengineering and computer science degrees are less useful\\nbecause all the jobs are going to India and China is silliness;\\nignore it.\\nHard science degrees \u2014 physics, chemistry \u2014 also clearly qualify, as do mathematics and economics.\\nWhy do I take this stance?\\n\u2022 Technical degrees teach you how to do something diZcult\\nand useful that matters in the real world. Even if you don\u2019t\\nend up actually doing what the degree teaches you how to do,\\ngoing through the experience of learning how to do it will\\nhelp you go through other serious learning experiences in\\nyour career. Complexity and diZculty will not faze you.\\n\u2022 Plus, technical degrees teach you how think like an engineer,\\na scientist, an economist, or a mathematician \u2014 how to use\\nreason, logic, and data. This is incredibly useful in the real\\nworld, which generally demands rigorous thinking on the\\npath to doing anything big.\\n\u2022 Plus, technical degrees indicate seriousness of purpose to\\nfuture employers and partners. You get coded right up front\\nas someone who is intent on doing real things.\\nGraduating with a technical degree is like heading out into the real\\n108 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nworld armed with an assault riGe instead of a dull knife. Don\u2019t miss\\nthat opportunity because of some fuzzy romanticized view of\\nliberal arts broadening your horizons.\\nWhat graduate degrees are useful in the\\nreal world?\\nGenerally, if you have a useful undergrad degree, I think graduate degrees are overrated. You can usually hit the workforce in a\\nreal job with just an undergraduate degree and progress rapidly\\naccording to your own ability and energy from there.\\nOf course, you\u2019re hearing this from someone who could barely\\nstand to stay in school long enough to Xnish undergrad, so take\\nthat for what it\u2019s worth.\\nIf you don\u2019t have a useful undergrad degree, then a useful graduate degree is deFnitely a great idea. Business, math, economics,\\nscience \u2014 something practical, substantive.\\nQuite a few people in business have paired a liberal arts undergrad degree with an MBA. They seem to do just Xne. But I think\\nthat\u2019s a missed opportunity \u2014 much better would be an MBA\\non top of an engineering or math undergraduate degree. People with that combination are invaluable, and there aren\u2019t nearly\\nenough of them running around.\\nAs far as PhDs are concerned \u2014 some of my best friends have\\nPhDs. However, most of the people who have a huge impact\\non the world \u2014 outside of pure research and education \u2014 do\\nnot have PhDs. Draw from that whatever conclusion you think\\nmakes sense.\\nWhat college or university should I go to?\\nTry very very hard to go to one of the best colleges or universities in the world for your chosen Xeld.\\nDon\u2019t worry about being a small Fsh in a big pond \u2014 you want to\\nalways be in the best pond possible, because that\u2019s how you will get\\nPart 2: Skills and education 109\\nexposed to the best people and the best opportunities in your\\nXeld.\\nIf you can\u2019t start out in one of the top schools for your Xeld, then\\nwork your butt oW and get great grades and transfer as fast as\\nyou possibly can into a top school.\\nAnd if you can\u2019t do that \u2014 if you end up getting your undergrad\\nat a school that\u2019s not one of the top in your Xeld \u2014 then strongly\\nconsider pursuing a graduate degree in your Xeld at a great\\nschool for your Xeld.\\nIn this way, even if your only option is starting out at a community college, by the time you Xnish 4-6 years of education, you\\ncan vault yourself into the top tier of your Xeld.\\nWhat should I do while I\u2019m in school?\\nI\u2019m a huge fan of gaining practical experience in school by working during the school year, and then doing as many internships\\nand co-op programs as you can.\\nParticularly at research universities \u2014 where you want to be \u2014\\nthere are lots of on-campus jobs that will give you highly valuable work experience. Take a job that will teach you something useful\\nand practical \u2014 the two obvious examples are working for a professor in your Xeld with an active research program who needs\\nundergrads to do some of the work, and being a staW member at\\na campus computer lab or research lab.\\nAnd then aggressively pursue internship and co-op programs \u2014 to\\nget real-world working experience at companies in your Xeld,\\nbefore you even graduate. Target the best companies in your\\nXeld, and go aaer the opportunities early and oaen.\\nIf you do this right, by the time you graduate even with just an\\nundergrad degree, you can have a year and a half of real working experience at high-quality companies plus another four\\nyears of practical experience from an on-campus job under\\nyour belt.\\n110 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nPlus, you will be implicitly demonstrating to future employers how determined you are to succeed and how hard you are willing\\nto work.\\nIn contrast, almost any other way you can spend your time\\nwhile in school aside from getting reasonably good grades is a\\nmistake.\\nHow should I think about skills\\ndevelopment once I\u2019m out of school?\\nYou should view graduating from school as just the beginning of\\nyour development of a whole portfolio of useful skills.\\nOne of the single best ways you can maximize the impact you\\nwill have on the world and the success you will have in your\\ncareer is by continuously developing and broadening your base of\\nskills.\\nMy favorite way of thinking about this is:\\nSeek to be a double/triple/quadruple threat.\\nScott Adams \u2014 the creator of Dilbert \u2014 nails it:\\nIf you want an average successful life, it doesn\u2019t take much planning. Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you\\nmight like. But if you want something extraordinary, you have two\\npaths:\\n\u2022 Become the best at one speciXc thing.\\n\u2022 Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.\\nThe Xrst strategy is diZcult to the point of near impossibility. Few\\npeople will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album. I don\u2019t\\nrecommend anyone even try.\\nThe second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas\\nin which they could be in the top 25% with some eWort. In my case,\\nI can draw better than most people, but I\u2019m hardly an artist. And\\nI\u2019m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never\\nmakes it big, but I\u2019m funnier than most people. The magic is that\\nfew people can draw well and write jokes. It\u2019s the combination of\\nthe two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my busiPart 2: Skills and education 111\\nness background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could\\nhope to understand without living it.\\n\u2026Get a degree in business on top of your engineering degree, law\\ndegree, medical degree, science degree, or whatever. Suddenly\\nyou\u2019re in charge, or maybe you\u2019re starting your own company\\nusing your combined knowledge.\\nCapitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable. You\\nmake yourself rare by combining two or more \u201cpretty goods\u201d until\\nno one else has your mix\u2026\\nIt sounds like generic advice, but you\u2019d be hard pressed to Xnd any\\nsuccessful person who didn\u2019t have about three skills in the top 25%.\\nThe fact is, this is even the secret formula to becoming a CEO. All\\nsuccessful CEO\u2019s are like this. They are almost never the best\\nproduct visionaries, or the best salespeople, or the best marketing people, or the best Xnance people, or even the best managers, but they are top 25% in some set of those skills, and\\nthen all of a sudden they\u2019re qualiXed to actually run something\\nimportant.\\nYou can apply this principle to the degrees you can choose to\\nget in school.\\nI already talked about combining an undergrad engineering\\ndegree with an MBA. I\u2019ll hire as many of those people as I possibly can.\\nAn MBA plus a law degree can be a great combination \u2014 and\\nprobably far more useful than either of those degrees by themselves.\\nOr even combine two undergrad degrees \u2014 computer science\\nplus physics, say, or physics plus economics.\\nYou can also apply this principle to skills that you develop once\\nyou leave school.\\nLet me cite as examples Fve skills that you can develop once you\\nleave school that, in combination with your degree or degrees\\nand your other skills, can help maximize your potential:\\n112 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nFirst, communication.\\nBack to Scott Adams:\\nI always advise young people to become good public speakers (top\\n25%). Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any\\nother, suddenly you\u2019re the boss of the people who have only one\\nskill\u2026\\nAt least one of the skills in your mixture should involve communication, either written or verbal.\\nThe great thing about communication is that most people are\\nterrible at it, because they never take it seriously as a skill to\\ndevelop.\\nThis is particularly true of engineers and technical people, who\\noaen quaintly believe that the world works logically and that\\npeople will automatically recognize the quality of things.\\nHa!\\nOf course, communication is critically important because it\u2019s\\nhow you convey information and concepts to lots of people in\\nways that will cause them to change their behavior.\\nThis is one good argument for certain liberal arts undergrad\\ndegrees, such as English. But you don\u2019t need speciXc college\\ntraining to be a good communicator \u2014 you can learn communication many other ways, including by doing, by practicing, by\\ntaking classes (how about a class in standup comedy? I\u2019m serious!), and by reading a lot. And communication in combination\\nwith some other useful skill is much more powerful than communication alone.\\nAn engineer or a Xnance person or a lawyer who can communicate is hugely more valuable than one who cannot.\\nAnd in the long run, you are going to have a very hard time ever\\nchanging the world if you can\u2019t communicate really well.\\nSecond, management.\\nIf at all possible, learn how to manage people.\\nPart 2: Skills and education 113\\nThe best way is to learn from a great manager.\\nEarly in your career, make sure you are working for a great\\nmanager \u2014 you\u2019ll know her when you see her in action \u2014 and\\nthen ask her to teach you how to do it.\\nAnd then give it a shot \u2014 ask for and get responsibility for a\\nteam of people whom you manage.\\nEven if your career path won\u2019t involve managing lots of people,\\nbeing able to manage will give you a highly valuable tool that\\nyou can pull out whenever you need it, instead of forcing you to\\nalways be reliant on other people to manage.\\nWorst case, you\u2019ll understand a lot more about why companies\\nwork the way they do and why people are the way they are.\\nWhich is hugely helpful when you set about doing something\\nnew.\\nThird, sales.\\nLearn how to sell.\\nI don\u2019t mean, learn how to sell someone a set of steak knives\\nthey don\u2019t need \u2014 although I hear that can be quite an education by itself.\\nI mean, learn how to convince people that something is in their\\nbest interest to do, even when they don\u2019t realize it up front.\\nThink of this as the art of being able to interact with people\\nsuch that they will do what you want, predictably and repeatedly, as long as you are making sense and oWering them something they should want.\\nThis is another terribly underrated skill, at least among people\\nwho aren\u2019t professional salespeople. But it\u2019s an incredibly general skill that can be helpful not only in your career but\\nthroughout your entire life.

Make\\nsure you start learning it early.\\nPart 2: Skills and education 119\\nPart 3: Where to go and why\\nWhen picking an industry to enter, my favorite rule of thumb is\\nthis:\\nPick an industry where the founders of the industry \u2014 the\\nfounders of the important companies in the industry \u2014 are\\nstill alive and actively involved.\\nThis is easy to Xgure out \u2014 just look at the CEO, chairman or\\nchairwoman, and board of directors for the major companies in\\nthe industry.\\nIf the founders of the companies are currently serving as CEO, chairman or chairwoman, or board member of their companies, it\u2019s a good\\nindustry to enter. It is probably still young and vital, and there are\\nprobably still opportunities to exploit all over the place, either\\nat those companies or at new companies in that industry.\\nIf not \u2014 if the industry\u2019s founders are dead, or old and out of\\ntouch \u2014 beware. That industry is now dominated by companies\\nthat are being run by second or third or even fourth generation managers who inherited their companies pre-built, and are\\nserving as caretakers.\\nIf you are young and want to have an impact, you want to be in\\nan industry where there is a lot of growth and change and Iux\\nand opportunity.\\nAs an industry ages, the vitality drains out until all that\u2019s lea is a\\nset of ossiXed remnants in the form of oligopolostic entities of\\nwhich you would Xnd being a part to be completely soul-killing.\\nThe exception comes when an industry has gotten so old and\\nossiXed that the clear opportunity exists to up-end it and introduce a new order, a new way of doing things, and therefore a\\nnew set of companies.\\nIn some industries this happens routinely \u2014 e.g. every 10-20\\nyears. This is the case in technology, for example, and Xnancial\\nservices.\\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to happen ever in certain other industries which\\nI won\u2019t name for fear of being permanently cut oW from my\\nnecessary supply of oil, gas, music, and movies.\\nIf you\u2019re going to enter an old industry, make sure to do it on\\nthe side of the forces of radical change that threaten to up-end\\nthe existing order \u2014 and make sure that those forces of change\\nhave a reasonable chance at succeeding.\\nSecond rule of thumb:\\nOnce you have picked an industry, get right to the center of it\\nas fast as you possibly can.\\nYour target is the core of change and opportunity \u2014 Xgure\\nout where the action is and head there, and do not delay your\\nprogress for extraneous opportunities, no matter how lucrative\\nthey might be.\\nNever worry about being a small Hsh in a big pond. Being a big\\nXsh in a small pond sucks \u2014 you will hit the ceiling on what you\\ncan achieve quickly, and nobody will care. Optimize at all times\\nfor being in the most dynamic and exciting pond you can Fnd. That is\\nwhere the great opportunities can be found.\\nApply this rule when selecting which company to go to. Go to\\nthe company where all the action is happening.\\nOr, if you are going to join a startup or start your own company,\\nalways make sure that your startup is aimed at the largest and\\nPart 3: Where to go and why 121\\nmost interesting opportunity available \u2014 the new markets that\\nare growing fast and changing rapidly.\\nAlso apply this rule when selecting which city to live in. Go to\\nthe city where all the action is happening.\\nFor technology, at least in the US, this is Silicon Valley. For\\nentertainment, this is Los Angeles. For politics, Washington DC.\\nFor coWee, Seattle. For Xnancial services, New York \u2014 unless\\nyou are convinced that there are equally compelling opportunities someplace else, like London or Hong Kong or Shanghai.\\nIn my opinion, living anywhere other than the center of your industry\\nis a mistake. A lot of people \u2014 those who don\u2019t live in that place\\n\u2014 don\u2019t want to hear it. But it\u2019s true. Geographic locality is still\\n\u2014 even in the age of the Internet \u2014 critically important if you\\nwant to maximize your access to the best companies, the best\\npeople, and the best opportunities. You can always cite exceptions,\\nbut that\u2019s what they are: exceptions.\\nNo one cares who the top Xlmmaker in Chicago is \u2014 hell, people oaen don\u2019t even care who the top Xlmmaker in New York is,\\nand quite a lot of Xlms get made out of New York. On the other\\nhand, the top 50 Xlmmakers in Los Angeles are all very important people in their industry.\\nLet\u2019s Yavor all of the above with a little nuance:\\n\u201cCurrent importance\u201d may not be the same as \u201cgreatest\\nchange\u201d.\\nWhenever you believe that the currently dominant companies,\\nor cities, are not the places of greatest change and opportunity,\\nyou have a decision to make.\\nPerhaps New York, while clearly the Xnancial services capital of\\nthe world, is not the place of greatest opportunity for someone\\nnew. Perhaps, for you, that would be Dubai, or Buenos Aires, or\\nPrague, or Macau.\\nAnd perhaps Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, Citigroup, and JP Morgan Chase, while clearly the most\\n122 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nimportant Xnancial services companies in the world, are not the\\ncompanies of greatest opportunity for someone new. Perhaps,\\nfor you, that\u2019s a totally diWerent kind of Xnancial services company, like Paypal.\\nThen you have a decision to make \u2014 whether to tilt a little\\nconservative and stick with the currently most important place\\nand companies under the rationale that they are still the major\\nagents of change in the industry, or tilt aggressive and go someplace or to some Xrm that\u2019s up and coming and might represent\\ndisruptive change and therefore even greater opportunity.\\nEither way, to quote Pink Floyd, \u201cset the controls for the heart of\\nthe sun\u201d \u2014 be sure you\u2019re heading where the action is, where the\\nbiggest opportunities in your Xeld are, as you\u2019ve chosen to think\\nabout it. Don\u2019t fart around in second and third tier companies\\nthat don\u2019t have a clear mission to dominate their markets.\\nThird rule:\\nIn a rapidly changing Held like technology, the best place to\\nget experience when you\u2019re starting out is in younger, highgrowth companies.\\n(This is not necessarily true in older and more established\\nindustries, but those aren\u2019t the industries we\u2019re talking about.)\\nThere are a bunch of great things that you get when you go to\\na younger, high-growth company:\\n\u2022 You\u2019ll get to do lots of stuE.There will be so much stuW to do in\\nthe company that you\u2019ll be able to do as much of it as you\\ncan possibly handle. Which means you\u2019ll gain skills and\\nexperience very quickly.\\n\u2022 You\u2019ll probably get promoted quickly.Fast-growing companies are\\ncharacterized by a chronic lack of people who can step up to\\nall the important new leadership jobs that are being created\\nall the time. If you are aggressive and performing well,\\npromotions will come quickly and easily.\\n\u2022 You\u2019ll get used to being in a high-energy, rapidly-changing\\nenvironment with sharp people and high expectations.It\u2019s like\\nPart 3: Where to go and why 123\\ntraining for a marathon while wearing ankle weights \u2014 if you\\never end up going to a big company, you\u2019ll blow everyone\\naway.

The way things\\nwork at a big company is usually unique to big companies. So,\\nworking for a big company is oaen a statement that you plan\\nto spend your career at big companies \u2014 and lots of people are\\nvery happy doing that, but I doubt that\u2019s your intention or you\\nwouldn\u2019t be reading this post.\\nIn contrast to going to a startup: when you are Xrst starting your\\ncareer, you should realize that raw startups are highly variable in\\nterms of the experiences you will have. Some can be great, but\\nmany are very poorly managed and go nowhere. You will probably be better oW going somewhere that\u2019s already succeeding,\\ngain skills and experience, and then go to a startup.\\nIn contrast to going to a mediocre small or mid-sized company that\u2019s\\nnot growing: those are great places to go if you don\u2019t want to go\\nanywhere yourself. If you Xnd yourself stuck in one, either Xgure out how to get the company unstuck and on a fast growth\\npath, or get yourself unstuck.\\nThere is a caveat to all this, which is as follows:\\nDon\u2019t just be a \u201csummertime soldier\u201d \u2014 don\u2019t go someplace\\nbecause it\u2019s already successful, and then bail when things get\\ntough.\\nAny hiring manager for the rest of your career will be able to\\nread that on your resume just by looking at the dates.\\nHigh-growth companies virtually always hit speed bumps, or even huge\\n124 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\npotholes. StuW goes wrong. Going through the experience of gutting through the hard parts and coming out the other end will\\nbe a key part of your real-world education and will serve you\\nvery well down the road, especially if you ever start your own\\ncompany.\\nThen, once you\u2019ve racked up killer skills and experiences at a\\nhigh-growth company, feel free to go to a startup.\\nPicking which startup to join probably deserves its own post.\\nHowever, in a nutshell, look for one where you understand the product, see how it might Ft into a very large market, and really like and\\nrespect the people who are already there.\\nOr, start your own company.\\nIf your startup fails, try another one. If that one fails, get back\\ninto a high-growth company to reset your resume and get more\\nskills and experiences. Then start another company. Repeat as\\nnecessary until you change the world.\\nFinally, every job you take and every role you Hll will always\\nbe a tactical opportunity and a strategic opportunity.\\nThe tactical opportunity is obvious: kick ass and take names \u2014\\ngain skills and experiences that will be valuable to you in the\\nfuture, and do so well that everyone you work with is singing\\nyour praises for decades to come.\\nThe strategic opportunity is less obvious and oaen overlooked.\\nEvery job, every role, every company you go to is an opportunity to learn how a business works and how an industry works.\\nLearn everything you can about the business and the industry\\nin which you Xnd yourself.\\nThink strategically: how would I start a Xrm like this today? Or, if I\\nwere starting a company in this industry today, how would it be\\ndiWerent than this Xrm? Why is this Xrm and other Xrms in this\\nindustry doing what they do? What are the assumptions underneath their behavior? Should those assumptions be changing?\\nPart 3: Where to go and why 125\\nHow might this industry work diWerently? Which customers\\nare being underserved? What new technologies might change\\nthings completely? How were things working 10 years ago, versus today, versus 10 years from now? And, my favorite: if the\\ncreators of this industry were starting out today, what would\\nthey be doing now?\\nIn FX\u2019s great new series Damages, a young attorney named Ellen\\nParsons has gone to work for a famous law Xrm called Hewes\\nand Associates, run by the legendary, ruthless, and amoral Patty\\nHewes.

Maybe you\u2019ll get one or\\ntwo ideas \u2014 probably out of the ideas I stole from other people.\\nIf so, I have succeeded.\\nAnd here we go; let\u2019s start with a bang:\\nDon\u2019t keep a schedule\\nHe\u2019s crazy, you say!\\nI\u2019m totally serious. If you pull it oW \u2014 and in many structured\\njobs, you simply can\u2019t \u2014 this simple tip alone can make a huge\\ndiWerence in productivity.\\nBy not keeping a schedule, I mean: refuse to commit to meetings, appointments, or activities at any set time in any future\\nday.\\nAs a result, you can always work on whatever is most important\\nor most interesting, at any time.\\nWant to spend all day writing a research report? Do it!\\nWant to spend all day coding? Do it!\\nWant to spend all day at the cafe down the street reading a book\\non personal productivity? Do it!\\nWhen someone emails or calls to say, \u201cLet\u2019s meet on Tuesday at\\n3\u2033, the appropriate response is: \u201cI\u2019m not keeping a schedule for\\n2007, so I can\u2019t commit to that, but give me a call on Tuesday at\\n2:45 and if I\u2019m available, I\u2019ll meet with you.\u201d\\nOr, if it\u2019s important, say, \u201cYou know what, let\u2019s meet right now.\u201d\\nClearly this only works if you can get away with it. If you have\\na structured job, a structured job environment, or you\u2019re a CEO,\\nit will be hard to pull oW.\\nBut if you can do it, it\u2019s really liberating, and will lead to far\\nhigher productivity than almost any other tactic you can try.\\nThis idea comes from a wonderful book called A Perfect Mess,\\nwhich explains how not keeping a schedule has been key to\\nArnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s success as a movie star, politician, and\\nbusinessman over the last 20 years.\\nIf you have at any point in your life lived a relatively structured\\nexistence \u2014 probably due to some kind of job with regular oZce\\nhours, meetings, and the like \u2014 you will know that there is nothing more liberating than looking at your calendar and seeing\\nnothing but free time for weeks ahead to work on the most\\nimportant things in whatever order you want.\\nThis also gives you the best odds of maximizing Yow, which is a\\nwhole \u2018nother topic but highly related.\\n128 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nI\u2019ve been trying this tactic as an experiment in 2007, as those of\\nyou who have emailed me to suggest we get together or that I\\ngo to a conference or to a meeting will attest. And I am so much\\nhappier, I can\u2019t even tell you. I get so much more time to focus\\non the things that really matter \u2014 in my case, my two companies, my nonproXt boards, and my lovely wife.\\nThe other great thing about this tactic is that it doesn\u2019t have to\\nbe all or nothing \u2014 there are quite a few things that still sneak\\nonto my calendar that I really can\u2019t get out of. But one is still\\nable to draw the line between \u201cmust do\u201d and \u201csounds interesting\\nbut I\u2019m not keeping a schedule\u201d.\\nKeep three and only three lists: a Todo List,\\na Watch List, and a Later List.\\nThe more into lists you are, the more important this is.\\nInto the Todo List goes all the stuW you \u201cmust\u201d do \u2014 commitments, obligations, things that have to be done. A single list, possibly subcategorized by timeframe (today, this week, next week,\\nnext month).\\nInto the Watch List goes all the stuW going on in your life that\\nyou have to follow up on, wait for someone else to get back to\\nyou on, remind yourself of in the future, or otherwise remember.\\nInto the Later List goes everything else \u2014 everything you might\\nwant to do or will do when you have time or wish you could do.\\nIf it doesn\u2019t go on one of those three lists, it goes away.\\nEach night before you go to bed, prepare a\\n3\u00d75 index card with a short list of 3 to 5\\nthings that you will do the next day.\\nAnd then, the next day, do those things.\\nI sit down at my desk before I go to sleep, pull up my Todo List\\nThe Pmarca Guide to Personal Productivity 129\\n(which I keep in Microsoa Word\u2019s outline mode, due to long\\nhabit), and pick out the 3 to 5 things I am going to get done\\ntomorrow. I write those things on a fresh 3\u00d75 card, lay the card\\nout with my card keys, and go to bed. Then, the next day, I try\\nlike hell to get just those things done. If I do, it was a successful\\nday.\\nPeople who have tried lots of productivity porn techniques will\\ntell you that this is one of the most successful techniques they\\nhave ever tried.\\nOnce you get into the habit, you start to realize how many days\\nyou used to have when you wouldn\u2019t get 3 to 5 important/significant/meaningful things done during a day.\\nThen, throughout the rest of the day, use the back of the 3\u00d75\\ncard as your Anti-Todo List.\\nThis isn\u2019t a real list. And the name is tongue Xrmly in cheek.\\nWhat you do is this: every time you do something \u2014 anything\\n\u2014 useful during the day, write it down in your Anti-Todo List\\non the card.\\nEach time you do something, you get to write it down and you\\nget that little rush of endorphins that the mouse gets every time\\nhe presses the button in his cage and gets a food pellet.\\nAnd then at the end of the day, before you prepare tomorrow\u2019s\\n3\u00d75 card, take a look at today\u2019s card and its Anti-Todo list and\\nmarvel at all the things you actually got done that day.\\nThen tear it up and throw it away.\\nAnother day well spent, and productive.\\nI love this technique \u2014 being able to put more notches on my\\naccomplishment belt, so to speak, by writing down things on my\\nAnti-Todo list as I accomplish them throughout the day makes\\nme feel marvelously productive and eZcient. Far more so than\\nif I just did those things and didn\u2019t write them down.\\nPlus, you know those days when you\u2019re running around all day\\n130 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nand doing stuW and talking to people and making calls and\\nresponding to emails and Xlling out paperwork and you get\\nhome and you\u2019re completely exhausted and you say to yourself,\\n\u201cWhat the hell did I actually get done today?\u201d\\nYour Anti-Todo list has the answer.\\nBy the way, in order to do this, you have to carry a pen with\\nyou everywhere you go.

What\u2019s not to\\nlike?\\nStructured procrastination\\nThis is a great one.\\nThis one is liaed straight from the genius mind of John Perry,\\na philosophy professor at Stanford. (Read his original description, by all means. You even get to see a photo of him practicing\\njumping rope with seaweed on a beach while work awaits. Outstanding.)\\nThe gist of Structured Procrastination is that you should never\\nXght the tendency to procrastinate \u2014 instead, you should use it\\nto your advantage in order to get other things done.\\nGenerally in the course of a day, there is something you have to\\ndo that you are not doing because you are procrastinating.\\nWhile you\u2019re procrastinating, just do lots of other stuW instead.\\nAs John says, \u201cThe list of tasks one has in mind will be ordered\\nby importance. Tasks that seem most urgent and important are\\non top. But there are also worthwhile tasks to perform lower\\ndown on the list. Doing these tasks becomes a way of not doing\\nthe things higher up on the list. With this sort of appropriate\\ntask structure, the procrastinator becomes a useful citizen.\\nIndeed, the procrastinator can even acquire, as I have, a reputation for getting a lot done.\u201d\\nThe Pmarca Guide to Personal Productivity 131\\nReading John\u2019s essay was one of the single most profound\\nmoments of my entire life.\\nFor example, I hate making phone calls. Hate it. Love sending\\nemails, enjoy seeing people face to face (sometimes), but I hate\\nmaking phone calls.\\nI can get so much done while I am avoiding making a phone call\\nthat I need to make, I can barely believe it.\\nIn fact, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now.\\nThe other key two-word tactic\u2026\\nStrategic incompetence\\nThe best way to to make sure that you are never asked to do\\nsomething again is to royally screw it up the Xrst time you are\\nasked to do it.\\nOr, better yet, just say you know you will royally screw it up \u2014\\nmaintain a strong voice and a clear gaze, and you\u2019ll probably get\\noW the hook.\\nOf course, this assumes that there are other things that are more\\nimportant at which you are competent.\\nWhich, hopefully, there are.\\nOrganizing the company picnic, sending faxes or Fedexes,\\nnegotiating with insurance brokers, writing in plain English\u2026\\nthe list of things at which one can be strategically incompetent\\nis nearly endless.\\nDo email exactly twice a day\\n\u2014 say, once Xrst thing in the morning, and once at the end of\\nthe workday.\\nAllocated half an hour or whatever it takes, but otherwise, keep\\nyour email client shut and your email notiHcations turned oG.\\n132 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nAnyone who needs to reach you so urgently that it can\u2019t wait\\nuntil later in the day or tomorrow morning can call you, or send\\na runner, or send up smoke signals, or something else.\\nOr, more likely, Xnd someone else who can do whatever it is that\\nneeds doing.\\n(If you communicate with your spouse or key family members\\nvia email during the day, then just set up a separate email\\naccount just for them and leave that open all day, but keep\\nyour primary email closed. And never give out the family email\\naddress to anyone noncritical \u2014 including your boss.)\\nOnly doing email twice a day will make you far more productive\\nfor the rest of the day.\\nThe problem with email is that getting an email triggers that\\nsame endorphin hit I mentioned above \u2014 the one that a mouse\\ngets when he bonks on the button in the cage and gets a food\\npellet.\\nResponding to an email triggers that same hit.\\nThe pleasure chemical hits your neocortex and you go \u201cahhh\u201d\\ninside and feel like you\u2019ve done something.\\nSo you sit and work with your mail client open and you interrupt your work every time an email comes in and you answer it\\nand you send another email and you feel great in the moment.\\nBut what you\u2019re really doing is fracturing your time, interrupting your Yow, and killing your ability to focus on anything long\\nenough to get real high-quality work done.\\nThis one is far easier to say than do.

Actually,\\nsame is true for Review.)\\nThat\u2019s it.\\nYou can get away with this because modern email clients are so\\ngood at search (well, most of them \u2014 and you can always move\\nto GMail) that it\u2019s not worth the eWort to try to Xle emails into\\nlots of diWerent folders.\\nObviously you may need some additional permanent folders\\nfor important things like contracts, or emails from your doctor,\\nor the like, but these are exceptions and don\u2019t change your standard operating procedure.\\nDon\u2019t answer the phone\\nLet it go to voicemail, and then every few hours, screen your\\nvoicemails and batch the return calls.\\nSay, twice a day.\\nCell phones and family plans are so cheap these days that I think\\nthe best thing to do is have two cell phones with diWerent numbers \u2014 one for key family members, your closest friends, and\\nyour boss and a few coworkers, and the other for everyone else.\\nAnswer the Xrst one when it rings, but never answer the second\\none.\\nHide in an iPod\\nOne of the best and easiest ways to avoid distractions in the\\nworkplace is to be wearing those cute little IPod earbud headphones (or any other headphones of your choice).\\nThe Pmarca Guide to Personal Productivity 135\\nPeople, for some reason, feel much worse interrupting you if\\nyou are wearing headphones than if you\u2019re not.\\nIt\u2019s great \u2014 a lot of the time, people will walk up to you, start\\nto say something, notice the headphones, apologize (using exaggerated mouth motions), and walk away.\\nThis is great \u2014 half the time they didn\u2019t actually need to talk to\\nyou, and the other half of the time they can send an email that\\nyou can process at the end of the day during the second of your\\ntwo daily email sweeps.\\nHere\u2019s the best part: you don\u2019t actually have to be listening to\\nanything.\\nHell, you don\u2019t even have to have the headphones plugged into\\nanything.\\nSleeping and Eating\\nI\u2019m not going to talk a lot about getting up early or going to\\nbed late or anything else related to the course of a typical day,\\nbecause everyone\u2019s diWerent.\\nPersonally I go back and forth between being a night owl (99% of\\nthe time) and a morning person (1% \u2014 I\u2019m going to try to push\\nit to 2%).\\nBut the thing that matters almost more than anything in determining whether I\u2019ll have a happy, satisfying day is this: no matter what time you get up, start the day with a real, sit-down\\nbreakfast.\\nThis serves two purposes.\\nFirst, it fuels you up. Study aaer study have shown that breakfast\\nis, yes, the most important meal of the day.

Next time\\nmy mobile wiki-based GTD Outlook synchronized hipster PDA\\nreminds me, I\u2019ll check \u2018em out.\\nNotes based on reader feedback:\\nTurns out Robert Benchley wrote about structured procrastination back in 1949. Wonderful essay \u2014 highly recommended.\\nThe sharpest reaction has been to my theory of not keeping a\\nschedule. I\u2019ll stick to my theory but make (or re-make) a couple\\nof clarifying points.\\nFirst, it is certainly true that many people have jobs and responsibilities where they can\u2019t do that. Or maybe can only do it partially. And many people enjoy living a highly structured life and\\nobviously this approach is not for them.\\nBut if your reaction is, \u201cboy, I wish I could do that\u201d, then it may\\nwell be worth rethinking your approach to your career.\\nI can tell you from personal experience that being stuck in a role\\nwhere you have a lot of structure but feel like you never get any138 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nthing done is not the optimal way to advance in one\u2019s profession,\\nor maximize one\u2019s job satisfaction.\\nSecond, I do not recommend pursuing this approach in one\u2019s\\npersonal life :-).\\nOn another topic, the tactic of each night, write down the 3 to\\n5 things you need to do the next day has struck some people as\\ntoo simplistic.\\nThat may be the case for some people, but I can\u2019t tell you how\\nmany times I\u2019ve arrived home at night and am at a loss as to\\nwhat I actually got done that day, despite the fact that I worked\\nall day.\\nAnd I also can\u2019t tell you how oaen I\u2019ve had a huge, highly-structured todo list in front of me with 100 things on it and I stare\\nat it and am paralyzed into inaction (or, more likely, structured\\nprocrastination).\\nSo a day when I get 3 to 5 concrete, actionable things done in\\naddition to all the other stuW one has to do to get through the\\nday \u2014 well, that\u2019s a good day.\\nA few people have said, why not just use GTD (David Allen\u2019s\\n\u201cGetting Things Done\u201d approach).\\nWhile I Xnd GTD to be highly inspiring, in practice I think it\u2019s\\nawfully complex. At least if your job is based on project work (as\\nopposed to having a highly structured role like CEO or head of\\nsales).\\nFor me, an organization system that requires signiXcant time to\\ndeal with in and of itself is not optimal. Much better, for me at\\nleast, is to focus on stripping away nonessentials and freeing up\\nas much time as possible to deal with whatever is most important.\\nFinally, I discovered aaer writing this post that Paul Graham talks a bit about the role of time and focus in personal productivity in his essay on \u201cThe Power of the Marginal\u201d.\\nThe Pmarca Guide to Personal Productivity 139\\nThanks for all the comments!\\n140 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nPsychology and\\nEntrepreneurship\\nThe Psychology of Entrepreneurial\\nMisjudgment: Biases 1-6\\nCharlie Munger is an 80-something billionaire who cofounded\\ntop-tier law Xrm Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson and is Warren\\nBuffett\u2019s long-time partner and Vice-Chairman at Berkshire\\nHathaway, one of the most successful companies of all time.\\nSome people, including me, consider Mr. Munger to be an even\\nmore interesting thinker and writer than Mr. BuWett, and\\nrecently a group of Mr. Munger\u2019s friends assembled a compilation book of his most interesting thoughts and speeches\\ncalled Poor Charlie\u2019s Almanack, inspired by Ben Franklin\u2019s Poor\\nRichard\u2019s Almanack. (The Munger book is only available on Amazon in used form, although you can apparently buy a new\\ncopy here.)\\nMr. Munger\u2019s magnum opus speech, included in the book,\\nis The Psychology of Human Misjudgment \u2014 an exposition of 25\\nkey forms of human behavior that lead to misjudgment and\\nerror, derived from Mr. Munger\u2019s 60 years of business experience. Think of it as a practitioner\u2019s summary of human psychology and behavioral economics as observed in the real world.\\nIn this series of blog posts, I will walk through all 25 of the biases\\nMr. Munger identiXes, and then adapt them for the modern\\nentrepreneur. In each case I will start with relevant excerpts of\\nMr. Munger\u2019s speech, and then aaer that add my own thoughts.\\nOne: Reward and Punishment\\nSuperresponse Tendency\\nI place this tendency Xrst in my discussion because almost everyone thinks he fully recognizes how important incentives and disincentives are in changing cognition and behavior. But this is not\\noaen so. For instance, I think I\u2019ve been in the top Xve percent of\\nmy age cohort almost all my adult life in understanding the power\\nof incentives, and yet I\u2019ve always underestimated that power. Never\\na year passes but I get some surprise that pushes a little further my\\nappreciation of incentive superpower.\\n\u2026We [should] heed the general lesson implicit in the injunction of\\nBen Franklin in Poor Richard\u2019s Almanack: \u201cIf you would persuade,\\nappeal to interest and not to reason.\u201d This maxim is a wise guide\\nto a great and simple precaution in life: Never, ever, think about\\nsomething else when you should be thinking about the power of\\nincentives\u2026\\nOne of the most important consequences of incentive superpower\\nis what I call \u201cincentive caused bias.\u201d A man has an acculturated\\nnature making him a pretty decent fellow, and yet, driven both\\nconsciously and subconsciously by incentives, he drias into\\nimmoral behavior in order to get what he wants, a result he facilitates by rationalizing his bad behavior [like a salesman who harms\\nher customers by selling them the wrong product because she gets\\npaid more for selling it, versus the right product \u2014 see, e.g., the\\nmutual fund industry].\\n\u2026Another generalized consequence of incentive caused bias is that\\nman tends to \u201cgame\u201d all human systems, oaen displaying great\\ningenuity in wrongly serving himself at the expense of others.\\nAntigaming features, therefore, constitute a huge and necessary\\npart of almost all system design.\\n\u2026Military and naval organizations have very oaen been extreme\\nin using punishment [the inverse of reward] to change behavior,\\nprobably because they needed to cause extreme behavior. Around\\nthe time of Caesar, there was a European tribe that, when the\\nassembly horn blew, always killed the last warrior to reach his\\nassigned place, and no one enjoyed Xghting this tribe.\\nHuman response to incentives is indeed a huge behavioral\\nmotivator, and I think Mr. Munger is right that once you think\\nyou realize how big it is, you need to assume it\u2019s even bigger.\\nThe Psychology of Entrepreneurial Misjudgment: Biases 1-6 143\\nThis is why stock options work so well in startups \u2014 and the\\nfewer people in a startup, the better stock options work, since\\nwhen there are only a few people in a company, it\u2019s usually crystal clear to each person how her work will impact the value of\\nthe company.\\nThere is a wrong-headed and dangerous theory afoot that\\nrestricted stock (grants of fully in-the-money shares of stock) is\\na more appropriate motivator of employees of tech companies\\nthan stock options:\\nMr. Gates wanted Mr. BuWett\u2019s input on whether to drop options in\\nfavor of restricted stock at Microsoa. [Gates] recalls asking: \u201cHow\\nwill employees respond to getting a lottery ticket that gives them a\\ndeXnite amount instead of one that could amount to nothing or a\\nridiculous sum?\u201d\\nMr. BuWett\u2019s reply, according to Mr. Gates, was: \u201cMy wife would\\nrather have a ticket for one fur coat, than a ticket that gave her two\\nor nothing.\u201d\\nOvert sexism aside, from an incentive standpoint the result of\\nshiaing from stock options to restricted stock should be obvious: current employees will be incented to preserve value instead\\nof creating value. And new hires will by deXnition be people who\\nare conservative and change-averse, as the people who want\\nto swing for the fences and get rewarded for creating something new will go somewhere else, where they will receive stock\\noptions \u2014 in typically greater volume than anyone will ever\\ngrant restricted stock \u2014 and have greater upside.\\nAnd sure enough, in the wake of shiaing towards restricted\\nstock and away from stock options, Microsoa\u2019s stock has been\\nYat as a pancake. The incentive works.\\nNow, against that, it is true that stock options, particularly for\\npublic companies, have an oaen-destructive random component: they tend to increase in value in rising stock market environments and decrease in value (potentially to zero) in falling\\nstock market environments, regardless of whether value is being\\ncreated inside your particular company.\\nFor that reason, in the long run it probably makes sense for\\n144 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nsome new approach to stock-based compensation to be developed that both preserves the motivation to create as opposed\\nto preserve value, but factors out the environmental swings of\\nrising and falling stock markets. Some form of indexing against\\nmarket averages would probably do the trick. This has been\\ntried from time to time, and I expect it to be tried more in the\\nfuture, at least for public companies.\\nAs a company grows, stock options and other forms of equitybased motivation become less and less useful as an incentive\\ntool, since it becomes harder for many employees in a large\\ncompany to see how their individual behavior would have any\\neWect on the stock price of the overall corporation. So, more tactical incentives kick in, such as cash bonuses.\\nThe design of tactical incentives \u2014 e.g. bonuses \u2014 is a whole\\ntopic in and of itself, and is critically important as your company grows. The most signiXcant thing to keep in mind is that\\nhow the goals are designed really matters \u2014 as Mr. Munger says,\\npeople tend to game any system you put in place, and then they\\ntend to rationalize that gaming until they believe they really are\\ndoing the right thing.\\nI think it was Andy Grove who said that for every goal you put in\\nfront of someone, you should also put in place a counter-goal to restrict\\ngaming of the Frst goal.\\nSo, for example, if you are incenting your recruiters on the\\nnumber of new employees recruited and hired, you need to\\nalso give them a counter-goal (and tie it to their compensation)\\nthat measures the quality of the new hires three months in.\\nOtherwise the recruiters are guaranteed to give you what\\nyou don\u2019t want: a lot of mediocre new hires.\\nOne of the great unwritten Silicon Valley skewed incentive stories was a major datacenter vendor in the late 90\u2019s that incented\\nits salespeople based on bookings of long-term datacenter leases,\\nwithout suZcient counter-goals tied to revenue collection or\\nthe customer\u2019s ability to pay. Sure enough, soon the company\u2019s\\nreported bookings were heading straight up, revenue was Yat,\\nand cash headed straight down, resulting in a truly spectacular\\nThe Psychology of Entrepreneurial Misjudgment: Biases 1-6 145\\nbankruptcy. The salespeople got paid, though, so they were\\nhappy.\\nMore recently, skewed incentives in the mortgage industry \u2014\\nmortage issuers getting paid based on quantity of mortgages\\nissued, versus ability to pay \u2014 caused many of the current catastrophic Wall Street Xnancial meltdowns you get to read about\\nevery day.\\nEven engineers need counter-goals: incent engineers based\\npurely on a ship date, and you\u2019ll get a shipping product with lots\\nof bugs. Incent based on number of bugs Xxed, and you\u2019ll never\\nget any new features. And so on.\\nEspecially in smaller companies, peer pressure can be a very\\neWective form of incentive. This is greatly enabled and abetted\\nby transparency. People hate to be embarrassed in front of their\\npeer group, so if it\u2019s crystal clear who\u2019s performing well and who\\nisn\u2019t, poor performers will be highly motivated to improve \u2014\\nand if they\u2019re not, that\u2019s good to know, since obviously then you\\nreally need to Xre them.\\nFinally, any entrepreneur should be highly attuned to incentives\\nwhen hiring outside executives, especially a CEO. Hire a CEO\\nand give her a large stock-option grant with four-year vesting,\\nand you can guarantee she will sell the company in year four.\\nGive her a stock-option grant with accelerated vesting on\\nchange of control and she will sell the company sooner than\\nthat. Founders can get tripped up on this because they naturally\\nhave an emotional incentive to see the company succeed that\\nhired executives oaen do not share.\\nAnd of course, never get caught between a venture capitalist and\\nher incentives.\\nTwo: Liking/Loving Tendency\\n\u2026[W]hat will a man naturally come to like and love, apart from his\\nparent, spouse and child? Well, he will like and love being liked and\\nloved\u2026 [M]an will generally strive, lifelong, for the aWection and\\napproval of many people not related to him.\\n146 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nOne very practical consequence of Liking/Loving Tendency is that\\nit acts as a conditioning device that makes the liker or lover tend\\n(1) to ignore faults of, and comply with wishes of, the object of his\\naWection, (2) to favor people, products, and actions merely associated with the object of his aWection (as we shall see when we get\\nto \u201cInYuence-from-Mere-Association Tendency\u201d), and (3) to distort\\nother facts to facilitate love.\\nThe application of this principle to entrepreneurs is obvious:\\nentrepreneurs want to be liked just like everyone else, and wanting to be liked can be a major impediment to entrepreneurial\\nsuccess due to at least two major reasons.\\nFirst, an entrepreneur, like any CEO, has to make tough decisions about what her company will do, and those decisions will\\noaen run counter to the preferences of her employees. You\\ndon\u2019t have to be involved in that many startups to Xnd one\\nwhere the entrepreneur knows she needs to make a tough decision \u2014 such as change strategy, or cancel a Yawed project \u2014 but\\ncan\u2019t quite do it because employees won\u2019t like it. Of course this\\nalways backXres: employees also don\u2019t like leaders who don\u2019t\\nmake the tough decisions that have to be made.\\nSecond, an entrepreneur, like any manager, has to Xre people\\nwho aren\u2019t great or who aren\u2019t right for the tasks at hand. This\\nnaturally makes people not like you, particularly the people you\\nXre. But again, not doing this backXres: nobody great wants to\\nbe in a company populated by mediocre or ill-Xtting peers.\\nI think these pressures are intensiXed in a small company versus\\na larger company, because in a small company everyone tends\\nto know everyone else and people naturally form strong personal relationships within the group \u2014 so the desire to be liked\\nis stronger, and the perceived risk from making decisions that\\npeople won\u2019t like is higher.\\nA speciXc form of this dynamic in a startup is when you have\\nmultiple founders, of whom one is the CEO. The founder who\\nis the CEO inevitably discovers that it becomes very hard to stay\\nclose personal friends with the other founders.

This is worth\\nwatching carefully \u2014 if everyone agrees right up front that\\nwhatever you are doing makes total sense, it probably isn\u2019t a new\\nand radical enough idea to justify a new company.\\nThree: Disliking/Hating Tendency\\nIn a pattern obverse to Liking/Loving Tendency, the newly arrived\\nhuman is also \u201cborn to dislike and hate\u201d as triggered by normal and\\nabnormal triggering forces in its life\u2026\\nAs a result, the long history of man contains almost continuous\\nwar\u2026\\nDisliking/Hating Tendency also acts as a conditioning device that\\nmakes the disliker/hater tend to (1) ignore virtues in the object of\\ndislike, (2) dislike people, products, and actions merely associated\\nwith the object of his dislike, and (3) distort other facts to facilitate\\nhatred.\\nIf this is a problem inside your company, then you have bigger\\nissues than I can help you with.\\nHowever, I think this dynamic kicks in for a startup when thinking about competitors.\\nI see two destructive consequences of this bias in startups with\\ncompetitors:\\nFirst, I believe startups oaen overfocus on their competitors. It\u2019s\\nthe easiest thing in the world to orient yourself in opposition to\\nanother company in the same market, and to plan your actions\\nbased on what will cause damage to the competitor or block the\\ncompetitor from getting business.\\nIn the startup world, that oaen leads to multiple competitors\\nengaged in a shooting war in a market that\u2019s still too small for\\nanyone to succeed.\\nI think it\u2019s much better for a startup to focus on creating and\\n148 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\ndeveloping a large market, as opposed to Xghting over a small\\nmarket.\\nSo when your startup\u2019s competitive juices get Yowing \u2014 especially for the Xrst time \u2014 and you Xnd yourself Xxated on a\\ncompetitor, be sure to take a step back and say, is this really\\nwhat we want to be focused on right now \u2014 is the market we\u2019re\\nboth in really large enough to warrant this? If so, sure, go for it,\\nguns blazing. But if not, stepping back and thinking about how\\nto focus instead on creating a large market might be more valuable.\\nA variant on this dynamic is letting your competitor determine\\nyour strategy by watching what he does and then making countermoves. The issue here is that it\u2019s highly likely that neither\\none of you actually knows that much about what you are doing\\nyet \u2014 since you are in a new market, by deXnition \u2014 and while\\nyou know you don\u2019t know that much about what you\u2019re doing\\nyet, you only observe your competitors\u2019s deliberate actions as\\nopposed to seeing their equivalent or greater level of internal\\nconfusion. So they seem like they know what they\u2019re doing, and\\nso you fall into assuming they know more than you do, when\\nthey probably don\u2019t.\\nSecond, when you are in a truly competitive situation, this bias\\ncan easily lead you to underestimate your competitor by, as Mr.\\nMunger says, \u201cignoring virtues in the object of dislike\u201d.\\nHis product sucks, his salespeople aren\u2019t as good, his venture\\ncapitalists are those morons who backed that large datacenter\\nvendor that went bankrupt \u2014 and so on.\\nNotably, this attitude can become cultural in your company\\nvery quickly. I think that if you\u2019re in a shooting war, even if you\\nprivately think your competitor is an amoral pinhead, that you\\nestablish a tone that says, we\u2019ll assume that he\u2019s highly competent and has many Xne virtues, which we will respect and then\\nsystematically target with our own strengths and virtues until we\\nhave killed him.\\nThe Psychology of Entrepreneurial Misjudgment: Biases 1-6 149\\nFour: Doubt-Avoidance Tendency\\nThe brain of man is programmed with a tendency to quickly\\nremove doubt by reaching some decision.\\nIt is easy to see how evolution would make animals, over the eons,\\ndria toward such quick elimination of doubt.

Well, an unthreatened\\nman, thinking of nothing in particular, is not being prompted to\\nremove doubt through rushing to some decision. As we shall see\\nlater when we get to Social-Proof Tendency and Stress-InYuence\\nTendency, what usually triggers Doubt-Avoidance Tendency is\\nsome combination of (1) puzzlement and (2) stress.\\nThis is probably a good one for entrepreneurs.

Few people can list a lot of bad habits that they have\\neliminated, and some people cannot identify even one of these.\\nInstead, practically every one has a great many bad habits he has\\nlong maintained despite their being known as bad.

As far as I\u2019m aware, all we have are anecdotes.\\nHowever, a professor of psychology at University of California\\nDavis named Dean Simonton has conducted extensive research\\non age and creativity across many other Xelds, including science, literature, music, chess, Xlm, politics, and military combat.\\nDr. Simonton\u2019s research is unparalleled \u2014 he\u2019s spent his career\\nstudying this and related topics and his papers make for\\nabsolutely fascinating reading.\\nFor this post, I\u2019ll be concentrating on his paper Age and Outstanding Achievement: What Do We Know Aaer a Century of\\nResearch? from 1988. I haven\u2019t been able to Xnd a PDF of the\\npaper online but you can read a largely intact cached HTML\\nversion courtesy of Google Scholar.\\nLet\u2019s go to the paper:\\nFor centuries, thinkers have speculated about the association\\nbetween a person\u2019s age and exceptional accomplishment: Is there\\nan optimal age for a person to make a lasting contribution to\\nhuman culture or society? When during the life span can we expect\\nan individual to be most proliXc or inYuential?\\nYou can see why I think this is relevant.\\nHere we adopt the product-centered approach, that is, our focus\\nis on real-life achievements rather than performance on abstract\u2026\\nmeasures. \u2026\\n[A]chievement [takes] the form of noteworthy creativity\u2026 the goal\\nis to assess how productivity changes over the life span\u2026 [I] focus\\non individual accomplishment in such endeavors as science, philosophy, literature, music, and the visual arts. \u2026\\n[Studies like these focus] on three core topics: (a) the age curve that\\nspeciXes how creative output varies over the course of a career, (b)\\nthe connection between productive precocity, longevity, and rate\\nof output, and (c) the relation between quantity and quality of output (i.e., between \u201cproductivity\u201d and \u201ccreativity\u201d).\\nDr. Simonton also discusses leadership as distinct from creative\\nproduction, but I\u2019m ignoring the leadership part for now since\\nit\u2019s quite diWerent.\\nOne empirical generalization appears to be fairly secure: If one\\nplots creative output as a function of age, productivity tends to rise\\nfairly rapidly to a deXnite peak and thereaaer decline gradually\\nuntil output is about half the rate at the peak.\\nThis is the centerpiece of Dr. Simonton\u2019s overall theory across\\nmany domains. And is probably not unexpected. But here\u2019s\\nwhere it gets really interesting:\\n[T]he location of the peak, as well as the magnitude of the postpeak\\ndecline, tends to vary depending on the domain of creative\\nachievement.\\nAt one extreme, some Xelds are characterized by relatively early\\npeaks, usually around the early 30s or even late 20s in chronological units, with somewhat steep descents thereaaer, so that the output rate becomes less than one-quarter the maximum. This ageAge and the Entrepreneur: Some data 155\\nwise pattern apparently holds for such endeavors as lyric poetry,\\npure mathematics, and theoretical physics\u2026\\nThe typical trends in other endeavors may display a leisurely rise\\nto a comparatively late peak, in the late 40s or even 50s chronologically, with a minimal if not largely absent drop-oW aaerward. This\\nmore elongated curve holds for such domains as novel writing, history, philosophy, medicine, and general scholarship.\\nWell, that\u2019s interesting.\\nIt must be stressed that these interdisciplinary contrasts do not\\nappear to be arbitrary but instead have been shown to be invariant\\nacross diWerent cultures and distinct historical periods.\\nAs a case in point, the gap between the expected peaks for poets\\nand prose authors has been found in every major literary tradition\\nthroughout the world and for both living and dead languages.\\nIndeed, because an earlier productive optimum means that a writer\\ncan die younger without loss to his or her ultimate reputation,\\npoets exhibit a life expectancy, across the globe and through history, about a half dozen years less than prose writers do.\\nYou know what that means \u2014 if you\u2019re going to argue that\\nyounger entrepreneurs have a leg up, then you also have to\\nargue that they will have shorter lifespans. Fun with math!\\nYou may not be surprised to Xnd that in creative Xelds, the\\npower law rule \u2014 also known as the 80/20 rule \u2014 deXnitely\\napplies:\\nA small percentage of the workers in any given domain is responsible for the bulk of the work. Generally, the top 10% of the most\\nproliXc elite can be credited with around 50% of all contributions,\\nwhereas the bottom 50% of the least productive workers can claim\\nonly 15% of the total work, and the most productive contributor is\\nusually about 100 times more proliXc than the least.\\nHere\u2019s where it gets really interesting again:\\nPrecocity, longevity, and output rate are each strongly associated\\nwith Xnal lifetime output \u2014 that is, those who generate the most\\ncontributions at the end of a career also tend to have begun their\\ncareers at earlier ages, ended their careers at later ages, and produced at extraordinary rates throughout their careers. \u2026\\n156 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nThese three components are conspicuously linked with each other:\\nThose who are precocious also tend to display longevity, and both\\nprecocity and longevity are positively associated with high output\\nrates per age unit.\\nOK, so on to the main question, which is, when\u2019s the peak?\\nThose creators who make the most contributions tend to start\\nearly, end late, and produce at above-average rates, but are the\\nanticipated career peaks unchanged, earlier, or later in comparison\\nto what is seen for their less proliXc colleagues? Addressing this\\nquestion properly requires that we Xrst investigate the relation\\nbetween quantity and quality, both within and across careers. \u2026\\nThis is a very complex topic and Dr. Simonton goes into great\\ndetail about it throughout his work. I\u2019m going to gloss over it a\\nbit, but if you are interested in this topic, by all means dig into it\\nmore via Google Scholar.\\nFirst, if one calculates the age curves separately for major and\\nminor works within careers, the resulting functions are basically\\nidentical\u2026\\nSecond\u2026 minor and major contributions\u2026 Yuctuate together.\\nThose periods in a creator\u2019s life that see the most masterpieces also\\nwitness the greatest number of easily forgotten productions, on the\\naverage.\\nAnother way of saying the same thing is to note that the \u201cquality\\nratio,\u201d or the proportion of major products to total output per age\\nunit, tends to Yuctuate randomly over the course of any career. The\\nquality ratio neither increases nor decreases with age\u2026\\nThese outcomes are valid for both artistic and scientiXc modes of\\ncreative contribution. What these two results signify is that\u2026 age\\nbecomes irrelevant to determining the success of a particular contribution.\\nOK, that\u2019s interesting. Quality of output does not vary by age\u2026\\nwhich means, of course, that attempting to improve your batting average of hits versus misses is a waste of time as you\\nprogress through a creative career. Instead you should just focus\\non more at-bats \u2014 more output. Think about that one.\\nIf this sounds insane to you, Dr. Simonton points out that the\\nperiods of Beethoven\u2019s career that had the most hits also had the\\nAge and the Entrepreneur: Some data 157\\nmost misses \u2014 works that you never hear. As I am always fond\\nof asking in such circumstances, if Beethoven couldn\u2019t increase\\nhis batting average over time, what makes you think you can?\\n[C]reativity is a probabilistic consequence of productivity, a relationship that holds both within and across careers.\\nWithin single careers, the count of major works per age period\\nwill be a positive function of total works generated each period,\\nyielding a quality ratio that exhibits no systematic developmental\\ntrends.\\nAnd across careers, those individual creators who are the most productive will also tend, on the average, to be the most creative: Individual variation in quantity is positively associated with variation\\nin quality.\\nWow.\\nOK, next step:\\n[This] constant-probability-of-success model has an important\\nimplication for helping us understand the relation between total\\nlifetime output and the location of the peak age for creative\\nachievement within a single career.\\nBecause total lifetime output is positively related to total creative\\ncontributions and hence to ultimate eminence, and given that a\\ncreator\u2019s most distinguished work will appear in those career periods when productivity is highest, the peak age for creative impact\\nshould not vary as a function of either the success of the particular\\ncontribution or the Xnal fame of the creator. \u2026\\nThus, even though an impressive lifetime output of works, and\\nsubsequent distinction, is tied to precocity, longevity, and production rate, the expected age optimum for quantity and quality of\\ncontribution is dependent solely on the particular form of creative\\nexpression.\\nWow, again.\\nAnyone who demonstrates\u2026 an age decrement in achievement is\\nlikely to provoke controversy. Aaer all, aging is a phenomenon easy\\nenough to become defensive about, and such defensiveness is especially probable among those of us who are already past the putative\\nage peak for our particular Xeld of endeavor\u2026\\n158 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nI think Dr. Simonton is ready to start blogging.\\nHis paper then goes on to discuss many possible extrinsic factors such as health that could impair later-life output, but in the\\nend he concludes that the data is pretty conclusive that such\\nextrinsinc factors serve as \u201crandom shocks\u201d to any individual\u2019s\\ncareer that do not aWect the overall trends.\\nHe then goes on to discuss possible intrinsic factors that could\\nexplain a relationship between age and creative accomplishment:\\nG. M. Beard was not merely the earliest contributor [in 1874] to the\\nempirical literature on age and achievement but its Xrst theorist as\\nwell. According to him, creativity is a function of two underlying\\nfactors, enthusiasm and experience. Enthusiasm provides the\\nmotivational force behind persistent eWort, yet enthusiasm in the\\nabsence of the second factor yields just original work. Experience\\ngives the achiever the ability to separate wheat from chaW and to\\nexpress original ideas in a more intelligible and persistent fashion.\\nYet experience in the absence of enthusiasm produces merely routine contributions. Genuine creativity requires the balanced cooperation of both enthusiasm and experience.\\nBeard postulates, however, that these two essential components\\ndisplay quite distinctive distributions across the life span. Whereas\\nenthusiasm usually peaks early in life and steadily declines thereaaer, experience gradually increases as a positive monotonic function of age. The correct equilibrium between the two factors is\\nattained between the ages of 38 and 40, the most common age\\noptima for creative endeavors. Prior to that expected peak, an individual\u2019s output would be excessively original, and in the postpeak\\nphase the output would be overly routine. The career Yoruit in the\\nlate 30s thus represents the uniquely balanced juxtaposition of the\\nrhapsodies of youth and the wisdom of maturity.\\nHmmmmmm\u2026\\nBeard\u2019s theory is not without attractive features\u2026 Beard\u2019s account,\\nfor all its simplicity, can boast a respectable amount of explanatory\\npower. Besides handling the broad form of the age curve, this theory leads to an interpretation of why diWerent endeavors may peak\\nat distinct ages.\\nThe contrast between poetic and prose literature, for instance, can\\nbe interpreted as the immediate consequence of the assumption\\nAge and the Entrepreneur: Some data 159\\nthat the two domains demand a diWerent mix of the two factors:\\npoetry, more enthusiasm, and prose, more experience. Indeed, in\\nXelds in which expertise may be far more crucial than emotional\\nvigor, most notably in scholarship, we would anticipate little if any\\ndecline with age, and such is the case.\\nDr. Simonton, however, then goes on to explain that this theory\\ndoes not really match the data \u2014 for example, the data shows\\nthat quality of output in practically all Xelds does not decline\\nsystematically with age, which is what you\u2019d expect from Beard\u2019s\\ntheory.\\nThe paper then digs into possible correlations between intelligence as measured by such metrics as IQ, and creative output:\\n[E]ven if a minimal level of intelligence is requisite for achievement, beyond a threshold of around IQ 120 (the actual amount\\nvarying across Xelds), intellectual prowess becomes largely irrelevant in predicting individual diWerences in\u2026 creativity.\\nSo what have we learned in a nutshell?\\nGenerally, productivity \u2014 output \u2014 rises rapidly from the start\\nof a career to a peak and then declines gradually until retirement.\\n\u2022 This peak in productivity varies by Xeld, from the late 20s to\\nthe early 50s, for reasons that are Xeld-speciXc.\\n\u2022 Precocity, longevity, and output rate are linked. \u201cThose who\\nare precocious also tend to display longevity, and both\\nprecocity and longevity are positively associated with high\\noutput rates per age unit.\u201d High producers produce highly,\\nsystematically, over time.\\n\u2022 The odds of a hit versus a miss do not increase over time.\\nThe periods of one\u2019s career with the most hits will also have\\nthe most misses. So maximizing quantity \u2014 taking more\\nswings at the bat \u2014 is much higher payoW than trying to\\nimprove one\u2019s batting average.\\n\u2022 Intelligence, at least as measured by metrics such as IQ, is\\nlargely irrelevant.\\n160 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nSo here\u2019s my Xrst challenge: to anyone who has an opinion on\\nthe role of age and entrepreneurship \u2014 see if you can Xt your\\nopinion into this model!\\nAnd here\u2019s my second challenge: is entrepreneurship more like\\npoetry, pure mathematics, and theoretical physics \u2014 which\\nexhibit a peak age in one\u2019s late 20s or early 30s \u2014 or novel writing, history, philosophy, medicine, and general scholarship \u2014\\nwhich exhibit a peak age in one\u2019s late 40s or early 50s? And how,\\nand why?\\nAge and the Entrepreneur: Some data 161\\nLuck and the entrepreneur: The\\nfour kinds of luck\\nIn the last few weeks, I\u2019ve been reading huge stacks of books on\\nthe psychology of creativity and motivation \u2014 which is the reason for the relative scarcity of substantive blog posts. Said post\\nsituation will be remedied shortly, by a series of posts on \u2014 surprise! \u2014 the psychology of creativity and motivation.\\nBut Xrst, to complement my post on age and the entrepreneur from a few days ago, this post begins a series of occasional\\nposts about luck and the entrepreneur.\\nLuck is something that every successful entrepreneur will tell\\nyou plays a huge role in the diWerence between success and failure. Many of those successful entrepreneurs will only admit this\\nunder duress, though, because if luck does indeed play such a\\nhuge role, then that seriously dents the image of the successful\\nentrepreneur as an omniscient business genius.\\nMoreover, some of those people would shrug and say that luck\\nis simply out of your hands. Sometimes you have it, sometimes\\nyou don\u2019t. But perhaps there\u2019s more to it than that.\\nDr. James Austin, a neurologist and philosopher (!), wrote an\\noutstanding book called Chase, Chance, and Creativity \u2014 originally in 1978, then updated in 2003. It\u2019s the best book I\u2019ve read\\non the role of luck, chance, and serendipity in medical research\\n\u2014 or, for that matter, any creative endeavor. And because he\u2019s a\\nneurologist, he has a grounding in how the brain actually exerts\\nitself creatively \u2014 although there is more recent research on\\nthat topic that is even more illuminating (more on that later).\\nIn the book, Dr. Austin outlines his theory of the four kinds of\\nluck \u2014 or, as he calls it, chance; I will use the terms interchangeably.\\nFirst, he deXnes chance as follows:\\nChance\u2026 something fortuitous that happens unpredictably without\\ndiscernable human intention.\\nYup, that\u2019s luck.\\nChance is unintentional, it is capricious, but we needn\u2019t conclude\\nthat chance is immune from human interventions. However, one\\nmust be careful not to read any unconsciously purposeful intent\\ninto \u201cinterventions\u201d\u2026 [which] are to be viewed as accidental,\\nunwilled, inadvertent, and unforseeable.\\nIndeed, chance plays several distinct roles when humans react creatively with one another and with their environment\u2026\\nWe can observe chance arriving in four major forms and for four\\ndiWerent reasons. The principles involved aWect everyone.\\nHere\u2019s where it helps to be a neurologist writing on this topic:\\nThe four kinds of chance each have a diWerent kind of motor\\nexploratory activity and a diWerent kind of sensory receptivity.\\nThe [four] varieties of chance also involve distinctive personality\\ntraits and diWer in the way one particular individual inYuences\\nthem.\\nOK, so what are they?\\nIn Chance I, the good luck that occurs is completely accidental. It is\\npure blind luck that comes with no eWort on our part.\\nYup.\\nIn Chance II, something else has been added \u2014 motion.\\nYears ago, when I was rushing around in the laboratory [conducting\\nLuck and the entrepreneur: The four kinds of luck 163\\nmedical research], someone admonished me by asking, \u201cWhy all\\nthe busyness? One must distinguish between motion and progress\u201d.\\nYes, at some point this distinction must be made. But it cannot\\nalways be made Xrst. And it is not always made consciously.\\nTrue, waste motion should be avoided.

I have\\nnever heard of anyone stumbling on something sitting down.\u201d\\nOK, now here\u2019s where it gets interesting:\\nNow, as we move on to Chance III, we see blind luck, but it tiptoes\\nin soaly, dressed in camouYage.\\nChance presents only a faint clue, the potential opportunity exists,\\nbut it will be overlooked except by that one person uniquely\\nequipped to observe it, visualize it conceptually, and fully grasp its\\nsigniXcance.\\nChance III involves involves a special receptivity, discernment, and\\nintuitive grasp of signiXcance unique to one particular recipient.\\nLouis Pasteur characterized it for all time when he said, \u201cChance\\nfavors the prepared mind.\u201d\\nI thought that was Eric Bogosian in Under Siege 2: Dark Territory, but OK.\\n\u2026The classic example of [Chance III] occured in 1928, when Sir\\n164 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nAlexander Fleming\u2019s mind instantly fused at least Xve elements\\ninto a conceptually uniXed nexus [when he discovered penicillin \u2014\\none of the most important medical breakthroughs ever].\\nHe was at his work bench in the laboratory, made an observation,\\nand his mental sequences then went something like this: (a) I see\\nthat a mold has fallen by accident into my culture dish; (2) the\\nstaphylococcal colonies residing near it failed to grow; (3) therefore, the mold must have secreted something that killed the bacteria; (4) this reminds me of a similar experience I had once before;\\n(5) maybe this new \u201csomething\u201d from the mold could be used to kill\\nstaphylococci that cause human infections.\\nActually, Fleming\u2019s mind was exceptionally well prepared. Some\\nnine years earlier, while suWering from a cold [you can\u2019t make\\nthis stuW up], his own nasal drippings had found their way onto a\\nculture dish. He noted that the bacteria around his mucous were\\nkilled, and astutely followed up the lead. His experiments then\\nled him to discover\u2026 lysozyme\u2026 [which] proved inappropriate for\\nmedical use, but think of how receptive Fleming\u2019s mind was to the\\npenicillin mold when it later happened on the scene!\\nOK, what about Chance IV?\\n[Chance IV] favors the individualized action.\\nThis is the fourth element in good luck \u2014 an active, but unintentional, subtle individualized prompting of it.\\nPlease explain!\\nChance IV is the kind of luck that develops during a probing action\\nwhich has a distinctive personal Yavor.\\nThe English Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, summed up the\\nprinciple underlying Chance IV when he noted: \u201cWe make our fortunes and we call them fate.\u201d\\nChance IV comes to you, unsought, because of who you are and\\nhow you behave.\\n\u2026Chance IV is so personal, it is not easily understood by someone\\nelse the Xrst time around\u2026 here we probe into the subterranean\\nrecesses of personal hobbies and behavioral quirks that autobiographers know about, biographers rarely.\\n[In neurological terms], Chance III [is] concerned with personal sensory receptivity; its counterpart, Chance IV, [is] involved\\nwith personal motor behavior.\\nLuck and the entrepreneur: The four kinds of luck 165\\nPlease continue!\\n[You] have to look carefully to Xnd Chance IV for three reasons.\\nThe Xrst is that when it operates directly, it unfolds in an elliptical,\\nunorthodox manner.\\nThe second is that it oaen works indirectly.\\nThe third is that some problems it may help solve are uncommonly\\ndiZcult to understand because they have gone through a process of\\nselection.\\nWe must bear in mind that, by the time Chance IV Xnally occurs,\\nthe easy, more accessible problems will already have been solved\\nearlier by conventional actions, conventional logic, or by the operations of the other forms of chance. What remains late in the game,\\nthen, is a tough core of complex, resistant problems. Such problems yield to none but an unusual approach\u2026\\n[Chance IV involves] a kind of discrete behavioral performance\\nfocused in a highly speciXc manner.\\nHere\u2019s the money quote:\\nWhereas the lucky connections in Chance II might come to anyone\\nwith disposable energy as the happy by-product of any aimless,\\ncircular stirring of the pot, the links of Chance IV can be drawn\\ntogether and fused only by one quixotic rider cantering in on his\\nown homemade hobby horse to intercept the problem at an odd\\nangle.\\nA recap?\\nChance I is completely impersonal; you can\u2019t inYuence it.\\nChance II favors those who have a persistent curiosity about many\\nthings coupled with an energetic willingness to experiment and\\nexplore.\\nChance III favors those who have a suZcient background of sound\\nknowledge plus special abilities in observing, remembering, recalling, and quickly forming signiXcant new associations.\\nChance IV favors those with distinctive, if not eccentric hobbies,\\npersonal lifestyles, and motor behaviors.\\nThis of course leads to a number of challenges for how we live\\nour lives as entrepreneurs and creators in any Xeld:\\n166 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\n\u2022 How energetic are we?How inclined towards motion are we?\\nThose of you who read my Xrst age and the entrepreneur\\npost will recognize that this is a variation on the \u201coptimize\\nfor the maximum number of swings of the bat\u201d principle. In\\na highly uncertain world, a bias to action is key to catalyzing\\nsuccess, and luck, and is oaen to be preferred to thinking\\nthings through more throughly.\\n\u2022 How curious are we?How determined are we to learn about\\nour chosen Xeld, other Xelds, and the world around us? In my\\npost on hiring great people, I talked about the value I place\\non curiosity \u2014 and speciXcally, curiosity over intelligence.\\nThis is why. Curious people are more likely to already have\\nin their heads the building blocks for craaing a solution for\\nany particular problem they come across, versus the more\\nquote-unquote intelligent, but less curious, person who is\\ntrying to get by on logic and pure intellectual eWort.\\n\u2022 How Iexible and aggressive are we at synthesizing\u2013 at\\nlinking together multiple, disparate, apparently unrelated\\nexperiences on the Yy? I think this is a hard skill to\\nconsciously improve, but I think it is good to start most\\ncreative exercises with the idea that the solution may come\\nfrom any of our past experiences or knowledge, as opposed\\nto out of a textbook or the mouth of an expert. (And, if you\\nare a manager and you have someone who is particularly\\ngood at synthesis, promote her as fast as you possibly can.)\\n\u2022 How uniquely are we developing a personal point of view\\n\u2014 a personal approach\u2013 a personal set of \u201ceccentric hobbies,\\npersonal lifestyles, and motor behaviors\u201d that will uniquely\\nprepare us to create? This, in a nutshell, is why I believe that\\nmost creative people are better oW with more life experience\\nand journeys aXeld into seemingly unrelated areas, as\\nopposed to more formal domain-speciXc education \u2014 at\\nleast if they want to create.\\nIn short, I think there is a roadmap to getting luck on our side,\\nand I think this is it.\\nLuck and the entrepreneur: The four kinds of luck 167\\nSerial Entrepreneurs\\nSeveral days ago, Gary Rivlin of the New York Times called me\\nabout a story he was writing about the brilliant Max Levchin of\\nPaypal and Slide, and the general topic of serial entrepreneurs\\nin Silicon Valley. The story came out yesterday; below are the\\nnotes I prepared for my conversation with Gary.\\nIn a nutshell, Gary\u2019s question to me was: what makes serial\\nentrepreneurs tick? Why do people like Max keep going and\\nstart new companies when they could just park it on a beach and\\nsuck down mai tais?\\nFirst, in my experience, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are all over\\nthe map when it comes to personality and motivation. Some\\nare purely mercenary \u2014 one hit and they\u2019re out. Others just\\nlove the technology, and the business is a side eWect. Still others\\nare like Chauncey Gardiner in Being There. And some just love\\nstarting and building companies.\\nSecond, there were serial entrepreneurs in the past, but there\\nare certainly more now than ever before. There are many factors that lead to this \u2014 here are the big ones:\\n\u2022 There are simply more entrepreneurs now \u2014 due to the\\namazing surge in venture capital and the culture of startups\\nover the last 10-15 years \u2014 so you\u2019d expect more serial\\nentrepreneurs just based on that.\\n\u2022 A lot of new companies simply develop faster these days than\\nthey did in the past. Microsoa and Oracle, for example, both\\nput in 10 years of incredibly hard work before going public\\n(both founded in \u201976, IPO in \u201986), and they only had a few\\nhundred employees each when they went public \u2014 and those\\nwere the two biggest soaware successes of their era. Versus\\nthese days, when many companies are founded, built, scaled\\nup, and sold (or, yes, taken public!) in a few years. The\\nprocess can happen so fast that people are freed up much\\nfaster; therefore, upon being freed up they are younger and\\ntend to have more raw energy than people who in the past\\nwould have spent 10 or 20 or 30 years building a single\\ncompany \u2014 and by the time they freed up, they maybe\\ndidn\u2019t want to put that level of eWort into something again.\\n\u2022 Also because of the faster cycle time, when you start\\ncompany #2 you can assume that it won\u2019t necessarily\\nconsume the next 10-20-30 years of your life\u2026 This makes it\\neasier for people to say, OK, hey, it worked once, I\u2019ll try it\\nagain.\\n\u2022 The culture of startups in the Valley is clicking on all\\ncylinders \u2014 everything from fundraising to hiring to\\nbuilding out a management team to signing up lawyers and\\naccountants and bankers is simply easier than ever before.\\nI\u2019m talking in a macro sense \u2014 over the last 10 years, versus\\nprior decades, even considering the early 2000\u2032s bust. So it\u2019s\\njust easier to start the next company that it was the past \u2014\\nthe \u201cpain in the ass\u201d factor is lower.\\n\u2022 In terms of exit, there are some IPO\u2019s, but the big thing is\\nthat M&A is a widely accepted and viable exit. Big companies\\nin and related to the Valley have actually become quite good,\\nin general, at acquiring small companies \u2014 not perfect, but\\nquite good. They do it frequently, in order to build out their\\nproduct families or grow market share. This of course\\ninspires more companies to be started and tends to compress\\nthe time cycles further.\\nThird, all that said, it is striking how many of the truly revolutionary companies are started, at least in part, by people who\\nSerial Entrepreneurs 169\\nhaven\u2019t done it before. Google (Brin and Page), Yahoo (Yang and\\nFilo), Facebook (Zuckerberg), Apple (Jobs and Wozniak), etc.\\nWhen you see one of those really revolutionary companies and\\nthere\u2019s some young kid with the idea, of course, they oaen are\\nlinked up with one or more seasoned, experienced people \u2014\\nGoogle (Schmidt, Doerr, Moritz), Yahoo (Moritz, Koogle), Facebook (Thiel, Breyer), Apple (Markkula). So even there you see a\\nkind of a serial entrepreneur (or VC or executive) eWect which is\\nanother form of what you\u2019re talking about.\\nFourth, drilling deeper into the motivations of the great serial\\nentrepreneurs I know, the dominant themes are:\\n\u2022 Desire to prove oneself \u2014 either \u201cI can do it again \u2014 it wasn\u2019t\\na Yuke the Xrst time\u201d, or \u201cI was the junior partner last time,\\nnow I\u2019ll be the senior partner\u201d, or \u201cI got Xred from my last\\ncompany, I\u2019ll show those f****** VCs\u201d, or something like that.\\n\u2022 Desire to continue working and being productive \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m 26\\nor 30 or 34, I have a lot of energy, I have to keep moving, and\\nI\u2019m certainly not going to go to work for some boring big\\ncompany or be another hack VC\u2026 obviously I need to start\\nanother company\u201d.\\n\u2022 In love with the technology or a new idea \u2014 there\u2019s more of\\nthis than cynical people think.\\n\u2022 A feeling that we\u2019re in a unique time and place where it\u2019s\\npossible for us to start, build, and be successful with multiple\\ncompanies \u2014 it\u2019d be a shame to walk away from the\\nopportunity to continue to be a part of such a magical time\\nand place. This is a big motivator for me, by the way.\\nGrowing up, I would have never dreamed that an industry\\nlike this would exist or that I would get to be a part of it. I\\npinch myself every day.\\n\u2022 Money, but not just \u201cI can buy a fancier cashmere car cover\u201d\\nkind of thing (although there is some of that) \u2014 just as oaen I\\nthink it\u2019s money as a way to keep score (oaen in the form of\\nsomething like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe Mark Cuban is a billionaire\\nand I\u2019m not; I can do that too\u201d), or money as a way to have an\\nimpact on the world philanthropically \u2014 the more you make,\\n170 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nthe more you can give away. That last one is certainly\\nbecoming a bigger and bigger motivator for me.\\nWith any given serial entrepreneur, it\u2019s probably a mix of these.\\nFiLh, a sharply related topic to all of this is that the opportunities are bigger than ever before. It\u2019s not an accident that companies like Google or Facebook or Paypal just get huge, and\\napparently overnight.\\nFor the Xrst time in history, you have a global market of 1+ billion people, all connected over an interactive network where\\nthey\u2019re all a click away from you. That\u2019s amazing.\\nAnd 100 million new people are being added to that count every\\nyear, and that will continue for the next 30 years.\\nA huge and growing market makes all kinds of magical things\\npossible, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing now.\\nSerial Entrepreneurs 171\\nThe Back Pages\\nTop 10 science Dction novelists of\\nthe \\'00s ... so far (June 2007)\\nWe are blessed so far this decade with an amazing crop of new\\nscience Xction novelists.\\nWriting in a variety of styles, this crew is arguably more insightful, more interesting, higher intensity, and bolder than many\\n(but not all!) of their predecessors \u2014 and in my view revitalizing\\nthe genre at a time when more new technologies that will radically reshape all our lives are incubating and percolating than\\never before.\\nSo, taking nothing away from authors like David Brin who have\\nlong been established and continue to produce top-notch work,\\nhere are my nominations for the top 10 new science Xction novelists of \u2014 more or less \u2014 the decade, plus one bonus.\\nAnd, they\u2019re not all British.\\nCharles Stross\\nStross, in my opinion, is Xrst among equals \u2014 the single best\\nemerging talent with several outstanding novels in various styles\\nunder his belt and hopefully many more to come.\\n\u201cOne of us\u201d in the sense that his career includes a stint as \u2014\\nnot kidding \u2014 Linux columnist for Computer Shopper magazine,\\nStross is equally adept at both near-future and radically-extrap-\\nolated timeframes, and both hyper-serious and humorous\\nmoods.\\nGlasshouse is Stross\u2019s latest book and perhaps the best introduction to his work.

You\u2019ll\\nnever look at telephones that drop out of the sky the same way\\nagain.\\nAccelerando is the best envisioning of the Singularity committed to paper so far. This book is really cool, both in the sense\\nof how the kids mean it, and also in tone \u2014 the plot, which\\nspans about 100 years, is emotionally cold but amazingly inventive and highly likely to keep you up nights thinking hard about\\nwhere we\u2019re all headed in the long run.\\nThe Atrocity Archives and The Jennifer Morgue, in contrast,\\nare highly entertaining shaggy dog stories about an IT guy\\nnamed Bob who gets draaed into mankind\u2019s Xght against forces\\nof evil from another dimension \u2014 James Bond meets Call of\\nCthulhu meets The OZce.\\nFinally, Stross is also an active blogger with, let\u2019s say, strong\\npoints of view.\\nRichard Morgan\\nMorgan writes outstanding, page-turning, highly inventive military- and detective-Yavored hard science Xction set in turbulent\\nworlds where hard men are faced with hard challenges.\\nAltered Carbon is deXnitely the place to start, Morgan\u2019s Xrst and\\nperhaps most inventive novel, Robert Heinlein meets Raymond\\nChandler \u2014 and Xrst of a trio.\\n174 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nBroken Angels is a strong followup that tilts more towards military Xction while still occupying the same universe.\\nWoken Furies completes the trilogy with more hard-boiled\\naction featuring a protagonist who has to Xght a younger, and\\nreally mean, version of himself, which he does not enjoy.\\nThirteen is undoubtedly Morgan\u2019s best-written novel so far \u2014\\nthis is an author whose skills are growing rapidly, and this book\\nshows it. Not oZcially released in the US yet (I just read the\\nBritish version, Black Man, renamed for US consumption), Thirteen is a near-future story of genetic engineering gone badly\\nwrong \u2014 a future version of all those classic paranoid political\\nthrillers of the 70\u2019s but with a much harder edge. Highly recommended. Also very helpful re advising on things to think about\\nbefore booking your next trip back from Mars.\\nAlastair Reynolds\\nReynolds is the real deal \u2014 doctorate in astrophysics and former staW scientist at the European Space Agency \u2014 and writes\\nas if Robert Heinlein knew a thousand times more about science\\nand completely lost his ability to write for warm characters.\\nWhile Reynolds\u2019 work is cold and dark \u2014 almost sterile \u2014 in\\nhuman terms, he operates on a scale and scope seldom seen,\\nand everything he writes is grounded in real advanced theoretical physics. Highly recommended for anyone who likes largescale space opera and big ideas.\\nRevelation Space, Redemption Ark, and Absolution Gap \u2014\\ntogether, Reynolds\u2019 Yagship trilogy \u2014 are three of the darkest,\\nlargest-scale, and most scientiXcally complex hard science Xction novels ever written.

Quoting a reviewer on\\nAmazon:\\nWhen I was starting out as a PhD student in ArtiXcial Intelligence\\nat Carnegie Mellon, it was made known to us Xrst-year students\\nthat an unoZcial but necessary part of our education was to locate\\nand read a copy of an obscure science-Xction novella called True\\nNames. Since you couldn\u2019t Xnd it in bookstores, older grad students\\nand professors would directly mail order sets of ten and set up\\ninformal lending libraries \u2014 you would go, for example, to Hans\\nMoravec\u2019s oZce, and sign one out from a little cardboard box over\\nin the corner of his oZce. This was 1983 \u2014 the Internet was a toy\\nreserved for American academics, \u201cvirtual reality\u201d was not a popular topic, and the term \u201ccyberpunk\u201d had not been coined. One by\\none, we all tracked down copies, and all had the tops of our heads\\nblown oW by Vinge\u2019s incredible book.\\nTrue Names remains to this day one of the four or Xve most seminal science-Xction novels ever written, just in terms of the ideas it\\npresents, and the world it paints. It laid out the ideas that have been\\nsubsequently worked over so successfully by William Gibson and\\nNeal Stephenson. And it\u2019s well written. And it\u2019s fun.\\nSo what? Well, he\u2019s done it again.

This habit keeps them from being\\nfully invested. Sure, they\u2019re well protected during the occasional\\ncrash of 1929 or 2000, but by and large they massively underperform their peers who take advantage of the fact that most\\nyears, the economy grows, and the market goes up. They have\\ndisappointing careers and die unhappy and bitter.\\nIn reality it seems very diZcult to predict either a bubble or a\\ncrash.\\nLots of people predicted a stock market crash\u2026 in 1995, 1996,\\n1997, 1998, and 1999. They were correct in 2000. But as soon as\\nthe stock market recovered in 2003 and 2004, they were back at\\nit, and there have been similar predictions from noted pundits\\never since \u2014 incorrectly.\\nSimilarly, in the technology industry, there were people calling\\na bubble starting in 1995 and continuing through to 2000, with\\na short break for about two years, and then more bubble-calling\\never since.\\nIf you\u2019re going to listen to people who predict bubbles or\\ncrashes, you have to be ready to stay completely out of the market \u2014 the stock market, and the technology industry \u2014 almost\\nevery year of your life.\\nSecond, historically, bubbles are very, very rare.\\nIt\u2019s signiXcant that in books and papers that talk about bubbles,\\nBubbles on the brain (October 2009) 181\\nthere are simply not that many examples over the past 500\\nyears of capitalism.\\nYou\u2019ve got the South Sea bubble, the Dutch tulip bulb bubble,\\nthe bubble in Japanese stocks in the 1980\u2019s, the dot com bubble,\\nand a few others.\\nThey just don\u2019t happen that oaen, at least in relatively developed economies.\\nAnd they don\u2019t tend to happen more than once in a generation.\\n(Perhaps because many of the people who go through one are so\\ntraumatized that all they can do is sit around and worry about\\nanother one.)\\nInterestingly, modern economic research is in the process of\\ndebunking a number of historical bubbles.\\nIt looks increasingly plausible that had US monetary policy\\nbeen better run in the early 1930\u2019s, our view of what happened\\nin the 1920\u2019s would be far more benign.\\nIt also turns out that the Dutch tulip bubble is largely a myth.\\nSo generally speaking, if one is going to seriously call a bubble,\\none has to be aware that one is calling something that is\\nextremely rare.\\nThird, in the technology industry, lots of startups being funded\\nwith some succeeding and many failing does not equal a bubble.\\nIt equals status quo.\\nThe whole structure of how the technology industry gets\\nfunded \u2014 by venture capitalists, angel investors, and Wall Street\\n\u2014 is predicated on the baseball model.\\nOut of ten swings at the bat, you get maybe seven strikeouts, two\\nbase hits, and if you are lucky, one home run.\\nThe base hits and the home runs pay for all the strikeouts.\\nIf you\u2019re going to call a bubble on the basis of lots of bad startups\\n182 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\ngetting funded and failing, then you have to conclude that the\\nindustry is in a perpetual bubble, and has been for 40 years.\\nWhich may be fun, but isn\u2019t very useful.\\nLots of people running around starting questionable companies, launching marginal products, pitching third-tier VC\u2019s,\\nthrowing launch parties, shmoozing at conferences, blogging\\nenthusiastically, and otherwise acting bubbly does not a bubble\\nmake.\\nThat\u2019s just life in this business.\\nNote also what you don\u2019t see in the theoretical Web 2.0 bubble\\nof 2007.\\nIPO\u2019s.\\nLots and lots and lots of IPO\u2019s.\\nFor a theoretical bubble, that is just plain odd.\\nFourth, getting more speciXc about Internet businesses \u2014 things\\nhave changed a lot since the late 90\u2019s.\\nIt is far cheaper to start an Internet business today than it was in\\nthe late 90\u2019s.\\nThe market for Internet businesses today is much larger than it\\nwas in the late 90\u2019s.\\nAnd business models for Internet businesses today are much\\nmore solid than they were in the late 90\u2019s.\\nThis is a logical consequence of time passing, technology getting more broadly adopted, and the Internet going mainstream\\nas a consumer phenomenon.\\nPeople smarter than me have written about these factors at\\nlength elsewhere, so I won\u2019t dwell on them, unless there is speciXc interest.\\nBut my back of the envelope calculation is that it is about 10x\\ncheaper to start an Internet business today than it was in the\\nBubbles on the brain (October 2009) 183\\nlate 90\u2019s \u2014 due to commodity hardware, open source soaware,\\nmodern programming technologies, cheap bandwidth, the rise\\nof third-party ad networks, and other infrastructure factors.\\nAnd the market size for a new Internet business today is about\\n10x bigger than it was in the late 90\u2019s \u2014 there are about 10x\\nmore people online (really!), and they are far more used to\\ndoing things on the Internet today than they were in 1999.\\n(Want evidence of that last point? Clothing purchases are now\\nbigger than computer hardware and soaware sales online. I can\\nguarantee you that nobody who was involved in ecommerce in\\nthe mid-90\u2019s ever would have predicted that.)\\nThe Internet is a fully mainstream medium now, people love it,\\npeople are willing to do all kinds of things on it, and it\u2019s getting\\nreally cheap to oWer new services to those people.\\nFiah, and Xnally, there\u2019s the simple fact that the Internet businesses that are succeeding in 2007 are for the most part incredibly valuable, compelling services that lots of people like and that\\nare in general either making a lot of money or will be making a\\nlot of money quite quickly.\\nPeople laughed when Fox bought MySpace for $580 million, but\\nthat\u2019s a business that will generate nearly $300 million in revenue in 2007, and more in 2008.\\nAs an independent asset today, MySpace would probably be valued at between $3 billion and $5 billion today \u2014 perhaps higher.\\nCall that the deal of the decade.\\nSimilarly, Facebook is bringing in a lot more revenue than people think.\\nAnd then there\u2019s Google.\\nThese companies aren\u2019t pulling in all that revenue via some\\nkind of Ponzi scheme.\\nThis is money coming from real advertisers and real users for\\nreal services with real value.\\n184 The Pmarca Blog Archives\\nWhich makes total sense, amid the enormous mass migration\\nof consumer time and attention away from traditional media\\ntowards online media.\\nThese same factors apply all the way down the foodchain.\\nA high-growth online startup that gets bought for $100 million\\nor $200 million by a large Internet or media company isn\u2019t\\ngetting that kind of acquisition price just for the hell of it, but\\nrather because the acquirer can plug that startup\u2019s service into\\nits broader portfolio of services and make real money with it.\\nThese are big numbers, but remember, there are more than a\\nbillion people online now. That is a very large market \u2014 a lot\\nof people, spending a lot of time, buying a lot of things, in\\ntotally new ways at the same time as they are abandoning older\\nservices like newspapers, magazines, television, movie theaters,\\nand print catalogs.\\nSo, my view is that to call a bubble, you have to Xnd evidence of\\nit outside of the mainstream of the kinds of Internet businesses\\nthat are being built, sold, and run in 2007.\\nIn closing, I\u2019d be the last person to say that I never roll my eyes\\nat the next startup that\u2019s doing online wiki-based popularityranked video-podcast mobile social dating widgets for the dog\\nand cat owner market.\\nBut a bubble?\\nI doubt it.\\nBubbles on the brain (October 2009) 185\\nOK, you\\'re right, it IS a bubble\\n(October 2009)\\n[IMPORTANT WARNING: What follows is satire.

Dinnebeil\\nAs a result of America\u2019s entry into World War \\nI, on April 6, 1917, Atlantic County received a great expansion of its industrial economic \\nbase. Among the largest result of this expansion was the construction of Amatol, a planned shell-loading muni-tions plant and workers\u2019 village that once occupied a tract of 6,000 acres between East Hammonton and Elwood. Amatol and other World War I inspired construction e\ufb00orts, such as Camp Dix in Burlington County, are fas-cinating, in part due to the rapidity of their construction. In just nine months\u2019 time, the new town and manufac-tory at Amatol were completed and reached a population of 7,000. Today, the Pine Barrens have all but reclaimed the former site of Amatol.H/i.sc/s.sc/t.sc/o.sc/r.sc/y.sc\\n/T_he history of Amatol began in December 1917 \\nwith the incorporation of the Atlantic Loading Com-pany.\\n1 Acting under the aegis of the United States \\nGovernment, the Atlantic Loading Company received governmental contracts to construct a large munitions plant and an accompanying town to house workers. In early 1918, the Atlantic Loading Company had initially planned to build the munitions plant and town near Camp Dix, but the war department had concerns over water pollution and the safety of the camp\u2019s personnel, and told the contractor to locate elsewhere.\\n2 In testimony \\ngiven regarding Amatol, Lieutenant Colonel R. H. Haw-kins stated that Camp Dix was not selected \u201cbecause \\nTHE RESPONSE TO THE CALL FOR SPEED\\nTo the left, a work crew newly arrived in the South Jersey Pine Barrens, March 4, 1918, prepares to commence construction of Amatol, the World War I shell-loading facility and workers\u2019 town near Hammonton, New Jersey.

Although no de/f_inite source can be cited as to why the Hammonton-Mullica Township site was selected over the other three candidates, major reasons did include the potential quality of town life and the design of a safety zone. Additional testimony from Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins reveals this consideration: \u201cWe had to build rather attractive accommodations [at Amatol] . . . to get [people] there. . . .We had to make it just as attractive as we could in order to get people to stay there; particularly in view of the knowledge of most people of the danger.\u201d\\n5 \\nBeing situated between Atlantic City and Philadelphia, Amatol was conveniently located for ease of access to the Jersey Shore and a great metropolitan city. In addition to town amenities, Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins also explained that the size of Amatol\u20146,000 acres\u2014was meant as a \u201csubstantial safety zone.\u201d\\n6\\nC/o.sc/n.sc/s.sc/t.sc/r.sc/u.sc/c.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc D/e.sc/v.sc/e.sc/l.sc/o.sc/p.sc/m.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc\\nAfter the company made its /f_inal site determination, \\nthe Atlantic Loading Company immediately went to work, which caught neighboring towns by surprise. /T_he Tuckerton Beacon reported that on March 2, 1918, the residents of Elwood and Hammonton went to bed with a quiet night as if it had been any other.

Because of the \u201clinguistic turn\u201d in biomathematics, these mathematical models can be verbally coded (i.e., they can be explained entirely by words). For example, the great American linguist Noam Chomsky does not use explicit mathematical models when he applies biomathematics to language; instead, he uses philosophical reasoning to represent the mathematical models (e.g., see his work \u201cBiolinguistics and the Human Capacity\u201d). In a similar fashion, this can be done with the Declaration of Independence. By analyzing the United Constitution, the Gettysburg Address, and the Supreme Court case of Cotting v. Godard (1901), I will demonstrate that Declarationism is a fundamental American principle.\\n      First, Declarationism is a principle that, in its strictest, maintains that the Declaration of Independence is the Supreme Law of the Land, entitling all Americans to the rights of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness as well as the right to a people\u2019s government to continually provide for greater Safety and Happiness. Although it can be argued that the United States Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land, this would be in error. According to Andrew Dream Johnson, the Declaration of Independence is \u201csuperior\u201d to the United States Constitution because the Declaration of Independence declares, \u201cThat to secure these rights [of Life, Liberty, Safety, Happiness, and the pursuit of Happiness], Governments are instituted among Men,\u201d thus establishing the right for government to even exist. The confusion over which document is superior arises because contemporary Americans take Life, Liberty, and Safety for granted. If there is a direct threat to our Life, then the Declaration of Independence takes precedence. In other words, all Americans are entitled to the right of Life first, then Liberty second, and then the pursuit of Happiness third, and finally the right to a people\u2019s government that continually provides for greater Safety and Happiness. This is the principle of Declarationism.\\n     Article VII of the United States Constitution connects the United States Constitution, particularly, the Bill of Rights, to the Declaration of Independence. Article VII, with the Bill of Rights, establishes the right to Liberty that People are entitled to. Article VII states, \u201cThe Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.\u201d This means that of the original thirteen States who signed the Declaration of Independence, nine of them must now agree for \u201cthis\u201d Constitution to take effect. The States were ultimately agreeing to the Bill of Rights, signaling that this is the Liberty that People have a right to and that this is the Liberty that governments must protect. In other words, the Bill of Rights now defines the Liberty that the Declaration of Independence guarantees for all People.\\n     Article VII also connects Article VI of the United States Constitution to the Declaration of Independence. Article VI defines the right to the pursuit of Happiness that People are entitled to, which essentially amounts to freedom of religion and to freedom of culture. The first part of Article VI states, \u201cAll Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.\u201d This means that the United States Government will honor existing and outstanding contracts that have been entered on behalf of the United States of America. This allows the United States of America to honor the very real sacrifice that American Soldiers and People made during the American Revolution. The second part of Article VI states,\\nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\\n\\nThis means that the United States of America will honor a person\u2019s culture, in accordance with the United States Constitution, or strictly speaking, the Declaration of Independence. This is the Supremacy Clause. (In other words, no more cutting out women\u2019s genitals, which is a regrettable aspect of certain cultures.) This also specifically states that the United States of America will honor foreign \u201cTreaties,\u201d which is a fanciful term for \u201cdebts contracted.\u201d The third part of Article VI affirms freedom of religion, which is important to emphasize. The third part states, \\nThe Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\\n\\nThis is also fanciful wording to say that the United States of America will honor a person\u2019s religion, in accordance with the United States Constitution, or strictly speaking, the Declaration of Independence, by not requiring a religious Test. Article VI establishes the right to the pursuit of Happiness, entitling People to freedom of religion and to freedom of culture.\\n     Article VII also connects the Preamble of the United States Constitution to the Declaration of Independence. The Preamble captures the People\u2019s right to a government that will continually provide for greater Safety and Happiness. The Preamble states, \\nWe the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\\n\\nThe Preamble spells out the essential duties of government, which the People can do themselves if government fails to do so for some reason. A short equivalent of this in the Declaration of Independence would read, \u201cThat to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \u2026 [to continually provide for greater] Safety and Happiness.\u201d The Declaration of Independence, through Article VII of the United States Constitution, has evolved to include the Preamble, Article VI, and the Bill of Rights defining our rights of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness as well as the right to a people\u2019s government.\\n     The Gettysburg Address establishes that the Civil War was ultimately fought to preserve the Declaration of Independence (as well as the Preamble of the United States Constitution). Abraham Lincoln begins the Gettysburg Address by declaring that America was born in 1776 with the Declaration of Independence, symbolizing that all People are entitled to the rights of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. He also offers the reflection that America was a nation truly \u201cconceived in Liberty.\u201d In other words, if the birth of America was in 1776, then the Americans who died before 1776 truly died for Liberty (and not for the Declaration of Independence). These Americans would be the epitome of Patrick Henry\u2019s \u201cgive me Liberty, or give me Death.\u201d Abraham Lincoln concludes the Gettysburg Address by capturing the essence of the Preamble of the United States Constitution\u2014that government is \u201cof the people, by the people, for the people\u201d and that this form of government \u201cshall not perish from this earth.\u201d This is the \u201cjust consent\u201d that the Declaration of Independence guarantees us. The Fourteenth Amendment also came out of the Civil War, establishing that States cannot infringe upon the rights of life, liberty, and property.\\n     The United States Supreme Court has even captured the principle of Declarationism in a number of cases. The most notable is Cotting v. Godard in 1901, declaring:\\nThe first official action of this nation declared the foundation of government in these words: \u2018We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u2019 While such declaration of principles may not have the force of organic law, or be made the basis of judicial decision as to the limits of right and duty, and while in all cases reference must be had to the organic law of the nation for such limits, yet the latter is but the body and the letter of which the former is the thought and the spirit, and it is always safe to read the letter of the Constitution in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence. No duty rests more imperatively upon the courts than the enforcement of those constitutional provisions intended to secure that equality of rights which is the foundation of free government. \\n\\nThis describes how the United States Constitution should be read \u201cin the spirit\u201d of the Declaration of Independence. This statement also establishes that there are certain \u201cconstitutional provisions\u201d more essential than other provisions in securing our rights to Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. I have already described the most salient constitutional provisions necessary to understand the \u201climits of right and duty\u201d of the People. The Supreme Court here is practicing Declarationism in its reasoning.\\n     In the 21st-Century, a google search of Declarationism captures the current state of thought on Declarationism. The first website to appear with a google query of \u201cdeclarationism\u201d is a Wikipedia article on \u201cDeclarationism.\u201d The next website is an editorial posted on August 11, 2012 by Daniel McCarthy titled \u201cPerils of Declarationism.\u201d McCarthy offers a few warning points of a strict Declarationist revision of the Civil War, which provides a good balance to the points I made regarding the Gettysburg Address. The third website is for the urban dictionary term of \u201cdeclarationism.\u201d The fourth website is for the urban dictionary term of \u201cDeclarationist.\u201d The fifth website is the YouTube Channel for the owner of \u201cdeclarationism.com.\u201d The sixth website is declarationism.com, which is owned by Andrew Dream Johnson. The seventh website is also owned by Andrew Dream Johnson, and was referenced in this paper. The eighth website is a politico-legal analysis posted on February 11, 2018 by Mateo Portelli titled \u201cA Case for Declarationism.\u201d Portelli provides a much greater look at the political and legal philosophy behind Declarationism. The ninth website is a reddit discussion on Declarationism. These are the websites that currently appear on the first page of a google search as of June 5, 2018. \\n     The second page of listings shows that there is formal academic research into Declarationism. For example, Professor Ken J. Kersch wrote a Maryland Law Review Article titled \u201cBeyond Originalism: Conservative Declarationism and Constitutional Redemption.\u201d Kersch defines Declarationism slightly different than Johnson, Portelli, or I. He writes, \u201cDeclarationism is the view that the Constitution can only be understood and interpreted in light of the principles enunciated in the opening words of the Declaration of Independence, which are held to be the Constitution\u2019s beating heart and unshakable foundation.\u201d (p. 229-230). This definition is also correct, although it does not have the same political force as the definitions that Johnson, Portelli, and I use. \\n     Through a biomathematical analysis of the Declaration of Independence, I have shown that the Preamble, Article VI, Article VII, the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment are all part and parcel of the Declaration of Independence. This paper did not discuss how California Proposition 65 is also part of the Declaration of Independence because that is beyond the scope of this paper. The thesis of this paper was to demonstrate that Declarationism is a fundamental American principle, and that I have done.\\n\\nBibliography\\nArticle VI of the United States Constitution.

Vibe coding is here.', 'All Aboard for Amatol, NJ\\n\\nAs a result of America\u2019s entry into World War I, Atlantic County received a great expansion of its industrial economic base. The largest result of this expansion was the construction of Amatol, a planned shell-loading munitions plant and workers\u2019 village that once occupied a tract of 6,000 acres between East Hammonton and Elwood. What is fascinating about Amatol and other planned communities is the speed in which they were completed. In just nine months\u2019 time, the new town and manufactory were completed reaching a population of 7,000. Today, the Pine Barrens have all but reclaimed the former site of Amatol.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nThe history of Amatol begins in December 1917 with the incorporation of the Atlantic Loading Company.  Acting as an agent of the United States Government, the Atlantic Loading Company was contracted to construct a large munitions plant and an accompanying town to house the workers. In early 1918, the Atlantic Loading Company planned to build the munitions plant and town near Camp Dix, but because of concerns over water pollution, another location had to be selected.  In addition, there were also concerns over the safety of soldiers at Camp Dix due to possible accidents. In testimony given regarding Amatol, Lieutenant Colonel R.H. Hawkins stated that Camp Dix was not selected \u201cbecause the commanding officer of Camp Dix told us he did not want it near his soldiers.\u201d  \\n\\nOther sites were considered, including Toms River, Lakehurst, Lacey, and Hammonton.  Ultimately, Hammonton was selected. Although no definite source can be cited as to why Hammonton was selected over the other three sites, major reasons did include the potential quality of town life and the design of a safety zone. Additional testimony by Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins reveals this consideration: \u201cWe had to build rather attractive accommodations [at Amatol] . . . to get [people] there. . . .We had to make it just as attractive as we could in order to get people to stay there; particularly in view of the knowledge of most people of the danger.\u201d  Being situated between Atlantic City and Philadelphia, Amatol was conveniently located for ease of access to the Jersey Shore and a great metropolitan city. In addition to town amenities, Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins also explained that the size of Amatol\u20146,000 acres\u2014was meant as a \u201csubstantial safety zone.\u201d \\n\\nConstruction and Development\\n\\nAfter the final determination of the site had been made, the Atlantic Loading Company immediately went to work, which caught neighboring towns by surprise. The Tuckerton Beacon reported that on March 2, 1918, the residents of Elwood and Hammonton went to bed with a quiet night as it had been any other. To their surprise, they awoke to see a large force of strangers in their midst, a half hundred freight cars bearing the legend \u201cOrdnance Department U.S.A.,\u201d and heavy motor trucks noisily chugging in the streets.  The next day, March 4, construction began.\\n\\nA detailed description of the construction is recorded by Victor F. Hammel in the Construction and Operation of a Shell Loading Plant and the Town of Amatol, New Jersey, commonly known as the \u201cAmatol book\u201d. In total, 1,600 acres had to be cleared for the plant, and 38 acres had to be cleared and 255 acres trimmed for the town.  This was no easy task. The land was mostly wooded with some acres of swamp and was difficult to clear due to a \u201cdense, tangled nature of growth.\u201d  The initial workforce included forty men, and within the first week, the first bunkhouse and mess hall were built. \\n\\nDevelopment was rapid. By June, the population was nearly 2,000, and train service was added.  By August, advertisements for Amatol described it as \u201ca city with all modern improvements . . . with electric lights, a fire department, a police department, a modern sewage system, a modern water plant, a theatre, a Y.M.C.A, an auditorium, bowling alleys, and other city amenities.\u201d  Amatol also promised many employment opportunities, not just with the munitions plant, but with local businesses, like barbers, tailors, jewelers, watchmakers, and grocers.\\n\\nBy the signing of the armistice, plant and town structures included: 122 loading buildings, 159 storage buildings and magazines, 4 administration buildings, 6 office buildings, 22 industrial buildings, 7 hospitals, 16 recreation centres, 1 theatre, 18 mess halls, 4 garages, 15 warehouses, 21 railroad structures, 12 stables, 130 guardhouses, sentry boxes, searchlights, etc., 21 commercial stores, 98 male dormitories and bunkhouses, 21 female dormitories,  140 miscellaneous buildings, 24 Army barracks, 4 Y.M.C.A.\u2019s, 11 individual residences, 33 multiple houses,  227 workmen\u2019s houses, 1 post office, 1 school house, 2 fire houses, 444 tent tops, 96 two-roomed family apartments, 179 four-roomed family apartments, 23 three-roomed family apartments.  On average, there were four buildings built per day, which was a remarkable speed.  The final workforce included over 5,000 construction workers. \\n\\nThe town reached a peak population of 7,000,  had the capacity to house over 10,000,  and was planned to accommodate a possible population of 25,000. \\n\\nAmatol Plant\\n\\nLoading operations at the Amatol plant began on July 31, 1918, and on August 3, the first shell was loaded.  The plant was capable of loading \u201c60,000 shells of all sizes, 50,000 boosters, 50,000 hand grenades, and 20,000 rifle grenades per day, as well as components. To accomplish this work there were 15 smokeless-powder magazines, 33 T.N.T. magazines, 49 miscellaneous storage buildings, 642 plant structures in all.\u201d  The plant, during its operational lifespan, loaded over 9,000,000 rounds of ammunition of various types and sizes. \\nAlthough T.N.T. was preferred and used when available, amatol was used as an alternative due to the shortage of T.N.T. Amatol was \u201cthe main charge pressed into the shell (unless straight T.N.T. or a 50/50 mix was used), [and] contains 80 percent of ammonium nitrate and 20 percent of T.N.T.\u201d.  The one disadvantage of amatol was that ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture rapidly, and in time deteriorates. The life of a shell loaded with amatol was uncertain after five years while the life of a shell loaded with T.N.T. was indefinite, certainly at least 25 years. \\nThe Army\u2019s Ordnance Department took over the plant in February 1919 and denominated it Amatol Arsenal.  By 1923, Amatol Arsenal ceased operations.\\nCamp Amatol\\n\\nIn October 1918, 2,400 troops arrived at Amatol to assist in operations there.  Their job was to bring the output to full loading capacity and they would even perform civilian tasks. In an October 14 article, many of these soldiers decided to take French leave\u2014an unauthorized departure\u2014by traveling to Atlantic City. A few of the soldiers were jailed when they were unable to show \u201cleave of absence.\u201d  By the time of the armistice, there were 3,800 officers and enlisted men at Camp Amatol, as it became known. \\n\\nThere were also Camp Amatol sports teams. Basketball was a big sport played amongst soldiers, including officers. A December 6, 1918 article records, \u201cthe Hammonton five defeated the U.S. Ordnance quintet from Camp Amatol by the score of 19 to 10.\u201d  A December 13, 1918 article describes how the U.S. Ordnance Officers team defeated the Amatol team in basketball by the score of 25 to 10.  \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn just a matter of months after signing the Armistice, the population of Amatol had virtually vanished, with only a few hundred remaining there. The former munitions complex experienced a brief resurgence in 1926 after an investor backed the construction of the Atlantic City Speedway there. The revival was short-lived as interest quickly waned among the visiting public and other investors. \\n\\nLittle remains of Amatol today. After a hike through the Pine Barrens, remnants of the munitions plant, town, and racetrack can be found at the former site of Amatol. Of the many buildings and homes that were constructed, only two still remain: the now-abandoned State Police barracks outside of Hammonton and one house, which was moved to the White Horse Pike, where it is still occupied.  During the 1980s, the Amatol site was considered for a landfill, but the proposal was shot down due to environmental concerns and an opposition by local residents.  Recently, in 2017, more than 500 acres of Amatol (now the Pine Barrens) were preserved. \\n\\nAmatol was not the only planned community that South Jersey saw built during World War I. Belcoville, Atlantic County, was also built as a munitions plant and village. Yorkship Village (now Fairview), Camden County, was built to house shipyard workers and their families. In addition, America also saw many new military bases built, which included Camp Dix (now Fort Dix), Burlington County.\\n\\nWhat was the overall impact of Amatol on the surrounding area? There is no reliable and readily-available information to answer this question. Where did the residents of Amatol go once operations ceased? According to the Press of Atlantic City, \u201cMany of Amatol\u2019s laborers, predominantly Irish and Polish from Philadelphia, stayed in the area and started families.\u201d \\n\\nAs the centennial of America\u2019s participation in the First World War draws to a close, it is good to take a moment to remember a little town, built in a forest in New Jersey, which helped with the war effort, and provided employment for thousands of American workers.\\n']\n"

      "The best way to write a loop in Python depends on what you want to achieve. Python offers several looping constructs, but the most common are `for` loops and `while` loops. Here are some guidelines to help you choose the best approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Using `for` Loops\n",
      "\n",
      "`for` loops are best when you know the number of iterations in advance or when iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example: Looping Through a List**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
      "for fruit in fruits:\n",
      "    print(fruit)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Using `while` Loops\n",
      "\n",
      "`while` loops are useful when you want to repeat an operation until a specific condition is met.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example: Using a While Loop**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "count = 0\n",
      "while count < 5:\n",
      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Tips for Writing Loops\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Keep It Simple**: Write clear and easy-to-read loop conditions. Avoid complex logic inside the loop.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Consider Using `enumerate`**: When you need the index of the items in addition to the item itself, use `enumerate`.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
      "       print(index, fruit)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Use List Comprehensions when Possible**: If you\u2019re transforming a list, a list comprehension can be more concise and readable.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   lengths = [len(fruit) for fruit in fruits]\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Break and Continue**: Use `break` to exit a loop prematurely and `continue` to skip to the next iteration.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   for fruit in fruits:\n",
      "       if fruit == \"banana\":\n",
      "           continue  # Skip banana\n",
      "       print(fruit)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Avoid Infinite Loops**: Always ensure your loop has a clear exit condition, especially with `while` loops.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The best way to write a loop is to choose the right type for your task, keep your loops simple, and maintain readability. If you have specific requirements or use cases, feel free to share, and I\u2019d be happy to provide more tailored advice!\n"

This often occurs because the CEO has difficulty relinquishing control over their area of expertise and prefers to be the dominant decision-maker. An example provided is that of Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who, despite being successful as a TV network executive, oversaw a situation where ABC fell to fourth place after its acquisition. His belief that he could personally turn the network around if he had more time exemplifies this issue, highlighting the tendency of executives to hire weaker leaders in their former specialties to maintain their own status as the primary authority in that area.\n",
