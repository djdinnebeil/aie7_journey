Dinnebeil\\nAs a result of America‚Äôs entry into World War \\nI, on April 6, 1917, Atlantic County received a great expansion of its industrial economic \\nbase. Among the largest result of this expansion was the construction of Amatol, a planned shell-loading muni-tions plant and workers‚Äô village that once occupied a tract of 6,000 acres between East Hammonton and Elwood. Amatol and other World War I inspired construction eÔ¨Äorts, such as Camp Dix in Burlington County, are fas-cinating, in part due to the rapidity of their construction. In just nine months‚Äô time, the new town and manufac-tory at Amatol were completed and reached a population of 7,000. Today, the Pine Barrens have all but reclaimed the former site of Amatol.H/i.sc/s.sc/t.sc/o.sc/r.sc/y.sc\\n/T_he history of Amatol began in December 1917 \\nwith the incorporation of the Atlantic Loading Com-pany.\\n1 Acting under the aegis of the United States \\nGovernment, the Atlantic Loading Company received governmental contracts to construct a large munitions plant and an accompanying town to house workers. In early 1918, the Atlantic Loading Company had initially planned to build the munitions plant and town near Camp Dix, but the war department had concerns over water pollution and the safety of the camp‚Äôs personnel, and told the contractor to locate elsewhere.\\n2 In testimony \\ngiven regarding Amatol, Lieutenant Colonel R. H. Haw-kins stated that Camp Dix was not selected ‚Äúbecause \\nTHE RESPONSE TO THE CALL FOR SPEED\\nTo the left, a work crew newly arrived in the South Jersey Pine Barrens, March 4, 1918, prepares to commence construction of Amatol, the World War I shell-loading facility and workers‚Äô town near Hammonton, New Jersey. The manufacturing plant was /f_irst built and loading operations began in July 1918. To the right is completed workers‚Äô town built in use nine months later. From Victor F. Hammel, Construction and Operation of a Shell Loading Plant and the Town of Amatol, New Jersey, 4.2SoJourn\\nthe commanding oÔ¨Écer of Camp Dix told us he did not \\nwant it near his soldiers.‚Äù3\\nOther sites considered included Toms River, \\nLakehurst, Lacey, and Hammonton.4 Ultimately, \\nHammonton was selected. Although no de/f_inite source can be cited as to why the Hammonton-Mullica Township site was selected over the other three candidates, major reasons did include the potential quality of town life and the design of a safety zone. Additional testimony from Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins reveals this consideration: ‚ÄúWe had to build rather attractive accommodations [at Amatol] . . . to get [people] there. . . .We had to make it just as attractive as we could in order to get people to stay there; particularly in view of the knowledge of most people of the danger.‚Äù\\n5 \\nBeing situated between Atlantic City and Philadelphia, Amatol was conveniently located for ease of access to the Jersey Shore and a great metropolitan city. In addition to town amenities, Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins also explained that the size of Amatol‚Äî6,000 acres‚Äîwas meant as a ‚Äúsubstantial safety zone.‚Äù\\n6\\nC/o.sc/n.sc/s.sc/t.sc/r.sc/u.sc/c.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc D/e.sc/v.sc/e.sc/l.sc/o.sc/p.sc/m.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc\\nAfter the company made its /f_inal site determination, \\nthe Atlantic Loading Company immediately went to work, which caught neighboring towns by surprise. /T_he Tuckerton Beacon reported that on March 2, 1918, the residents of Elwood and Hammonton went to bed with a quiet night as if it had been any other. To their surprise, they awoke to see a large force of strangers in their midst, a half hundred freight cars bearing the legend ‚ÄúOrdnance Department U.S.A.,‚Äù and heavy motor trucks noisily chugging in the streets.\\n7 /T_he next day, March 4, \\nconstruction began.\\nA company street, Amatol.

For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model‚Äôs behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
        "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
        "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main idea is this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
        "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
