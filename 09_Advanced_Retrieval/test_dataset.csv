How has Nelnet's handling of the re-amortization process affected borrowers following the end of the federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program?,"[""The federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX. However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position. The re-amortization should have occurred once the forbearance ended to reduce the impact to borrowers.""]","Nelnet's handling of the re-amortization process has resulted in a significant increase in payment amounts for borrowers, with payments nearly doubling from $180.00 per month to $360.00 per month. This change occurred only recently, despite the federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ending earlier. While some borrowers, like myself, may be able to manage the increased payments due to a stable financial position, there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position and may struggle with the higher payment amounts. The re-amortization should have been implemented immediately after the forbearance ended to mitigate the impact on borrowers.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer

I am requesting the CFPB hold them fully accountable for their lack of action and require proper investigation and correction. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX']","The mishandling of student loan accounts by EdFinancial, as described in the context, involves adding unjustified charges and ignoring legally binding facts about a borrower's enrollment status, which violates federal regulations that entitle students to deferment. This mismanagement can force borrowers into repayment status unlawfully. Similarly, TransUnion's failure to conduct a meaningful investigation into inaccurate credit reporting violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Metro 2 compliance procedures. This negligence results in the continued reporting of inaccurate information, causing financial and emotional distress to borrowers. Both cases highlight a disregard for borrowers' rights under federal regulations, leading to potential legal actions and complaints to the U.S. Department of Education and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
