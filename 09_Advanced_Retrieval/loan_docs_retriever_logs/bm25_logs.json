      "response": "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, through the FAFSA Simplification Act, brought significant changes to the FAFSA process, notably implementing the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) with the IRS. This replaced the previous IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT), allowing most applicants and their contributors to have their federal tax information (FTI) automatically imported into the FAFSA form with consent and approval. This change streamlined the application process, making it faster and less burdensome for students by reducing the need for manual income reporting and enhancing the accuracy of income data used for financial aid eligibility determination. Additionally, the transfer of FTI via FA-DDX is considered verified for Title IV purposes, further simplifying compliance and verification procedures.",

        "Application and Verification Guide\nIntroduction\nThis guide is intended for college financial aid administrators and counselors who help students with the financial aid\nprocess4completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, verifying information, and making\ncorrections and other changes to the information reported on the FAFSA form.\nThroughout the Federal Student Aid Handbook, we use <college,= <school,= and <institution= interchangeably unless a\nmore specific use is given. Similarly, <student,= <applicant,= and <aid recipient= are synonyms. <Parents= in this volume\nrefers to the legal parents of dependent students, and <you= refers to the primary audience of the Handbook: financial aid\nadministrators at colleges. <We= indicates the U.S. Department of Education (the Department, ED), and <federal student\naid= and <Title IV aid= are synonymous terms for the financial aid offered by the Department.\nWe appreciate any comments that you have on the Application and Verification Guide (AVG), as well as all the volumes of\nthe FSA Handbook. We revise the text based on questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please\nreach out to us about how to improve the FSA Handbook through the <Contact Customer Support= feature in our Partner\nConnect Help Center clicking on <FSA Handbook= under the Topic section.\nFAFSA Simplification Act\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a\nsignificant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need\nanalysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the\nFAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for\nEducation (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process.\nChanges From the FUTURE Act\nThe Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data\nexchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate\ncompleting the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data\nRetrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX\neliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information\nreported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered\nverified for Title IV purposes.\nUnlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s\nspouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via\nthe FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid.\nOther Changes\nThroughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references\nhave been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year.\nWhere appropriate, links and publications associated with FSA9s Partner Connect and Knowledge Center have been\nproperly updated. We also removed references to COVID-19 guidance and waivers.\nSome sections were moved to better align topics and assist with narrative flow. Use the search feature to find sections\nthat may have been relocated. The following describes changes made in each chapter.\nChapter 1: The Application Process\nWe removed the <Returning FAFSA Filers= section as FAFSA renewal functionality has been deferred for future cycles.",
        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3.\nThe easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported. However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form.\nFUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form.\nConsent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper).\nTo provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department.\nFAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",
        "Summary or, if the FPS has the student9s email address, an email with a link to view the student9s updated FAFSA\nSubmission Summary on the web.\nPaper FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who received a paper FAFSA Submission Summary may make\ncorrections or updates on it, then sign and return it to the FAFSA processor at the address given at the end of the FAFSA\nSubmission Summary. If a contributor9s information is updated or corrected, that contributor also must sign the FAFSA\nSubmission Summary before submitting it for processing.\nStudents who applied electronically are encouraged to return to their Dashboard on StudentAid.gov to make corrections.\nStudents who applied electronically but would like to make corrections via paper may have a paper FAFSA Submission\nSummary mailed to them by calling the FSAIC at 1-800-4-FED-AID and providing their name, SSN, and date of birth,\nthough this feature may not be available until later in the application cycle.\nAdding Schools and Changing a Student9s Address\nAs with other changes, a student can add schools or change their address, email address, or telephone number online or\non a paper FAFSA Submission Summary. A student can also update these items over the phone by calling 1-800-433-3243\nand providing their DRN, though this feature may not be available until later in the application cycle. You can submit\nthose changes for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal if your school is listed on the student9s application, or you\nhave the student9s DRN.\nThe FAFSA form has limited space for a student to list schools that will receive the application data: 10 schools can be\nlisted on the paper application; 20 schools can be listed on the online FAFSA form. If the student wants information sent to\nmore schools, the student can use any of the methods listed previously to replace some or all the original schools. If the\nstudent originally listed 20 schools on the application and then replaced two schools with two new ones, those that were\nreplaced will not receive an ISIR from this correction or any subsequent correction on which they did not appear.\nSignatures\nAny required signatures, such as those on worksheets or on copies of tax returns, must be collected at the time of\nverification4they cannot be collected after the verification deadline for that award year.\nFor verification documentation, a school may collect an electronic signature for an applicant, parent, or spouse if the\nprocess includes an assurance of the identity of the person signing. This is often accomplished with a PIN or password that\nis assigned only after the identity of the signer has been authenticated (see DOC-Q12 on the Program Integrity Questions\nand Answers 3 Verification).\nDeadlines and Failure to Submit Documentation\nYou must require students selected for verification4either by your school or the Department4to submit the\ndocumentation by the date specified by your school (for Campus-Based and Direct Loans) or the Department (for Pell).\nCampus-Based and Direct Loans\nIf a student doesn9t provide verification documentation within your school9s established, reasonable timeframe, you\ncannot:\nDisburse more FSEOG funds,\nEmploy or permit further FWS employment, or\nFailure to Submit Documentation\n34 CFR 668.60",
        "Students or parents who file an amended return (IRS Form 1040X) and provide consent and approval to retrieve FTI via\nthe FA-DDX will not have their amended information transferred to the FAFSA form. The IRS will transfer only original tax\ninformation to the FAFSA form via the FA-DDX. However, there is currently no indicator on the FAFSA form that the tax\nreturn was amended and the original data may be inaccurate. If you are aware that an applicant or contributor filed an\namended return, you must update or correct the applicant9s FAFSA form. You must also check the PJ flag on the corrected\nISIR transaction so that FPS recalculates the student9s SAI and Pell Grant eligibility using the manually entered tax\ninformation (instead of the FTI received via the FA-DDX).\nIf the applicant is selected for verification and you are aware that the applicant or a contributor has filed an amended\nreturn, you must use the amended return information to complete verification. However, if you were not previously aware\nthat an applicant or contributor filed an amended return, you are not required to confirm whether an amended return was\nfiled as part of the verification process. You may still consider the FTI transferred from the IRS to be verified if you have no\nreason to believe the applicant or a contributor filed an amended return.\nApplicants or contributors may submit a signed copy of the filed 1040X form and one of the following documents to\ncomplete verification:\nIncome and tax information from the IRS on an ISIR record with all tax information from the original tax return;\nA transcript obtained from the IRS that lists 2023 tax account information of the tax filer(s); or\nA signed copy of the 2023 IRS Form 1040 and the applicable schedules that were filed with the IRS.\nBecause the tax return transcript does not reflect changes to the original return by the filer or the IRS, it is, by itself, not\nsufficient.\nWhen an amended return was filed, you must submit any changes to nondollar items and to single monetary items of $25\nor more.\nNote that there may be instances when a student, spouse, or parent did not file a 1040X with the IRS but had their tax\nand income information amended by the IRS. In such a case a school may accept one of the items mentioned above plus\ndocumentation showing the IRS9s change(s).\nVictims of Tax-Related Identity Theft\nIndividuals who are victims of tax-related identity theft cannot get a return transcript or have their FTI transferred via the\nFA-DDX.\nIn the past we have requested individuals who are victims of IRS tax-related identity theft to obtain a Tax Return\nDataBase View (TRDBV) transcript from the IRS for verification purposes. However, the Department is aware that TRDBV\ntranscript requests have been taking over a year to process. Due to the long processing time, we will instead require\nindividuals who are victims of IRS tax-related identity theft to provide a copy of the following:\nA signed copy of the 2023 income tax return and applicable schedules the individual filed with the IRS; and\nAn IRS 4674C letter (a letter from the IRS acknowledging the identity theft) or a statement signed and dated by the\ntax filer indicating that he or she was a victim of IRS tax-related identity theft, and the IRS is aware of it.\nThis change to required documentation was provided in Dear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10.\nVerification for Confined or Incarcerated Individuals\nConfined or incarcerated individuals enrolled in approved prison education programs (PEPs) are eligible for Federal Pell\nGrants.\nFor the 2025-26 award year, a confined or incarcerated individual as indicated through the incarcerated applicant flag will\nonly be required to verify their identity and statement of educational purpose if selected for Verification Tracking Group\nV4 or V5. In addition, institutions are not required to verify a confined or incarcerated individual selected under\nVerification Tracking Flag V1.\nIf a confined or incarcerated student is unable to submit a signed and notarized statement of educational purpose, a\nschool may accept a signed statement from an authorized official who works for the correctional facility or the oversight"

        "guidance on returning aid in such situations in Volume 4, Chapter 3 of the FSA Handbook.\nAfter Documentation Is Complete\nWhen you have obtained all necessary verification documents from the student, you should compare them to the FAFSA\nSubmission Summary or ISIR you are reviewing for payment. If all the student9s information is correct or has been\ncorrected and there are no outstanding issues or unresolved conflicting information, you may award and disburse aid for\nwhich the student is eligible.\nSometimes schools ask if even further verification is needed to resolve discrepancies between the ISIR and what the\nstudent provided for verification. The answer is no unless you have reason to doubt the accuracy of the verification\ninformation. Acceptable documentation either confirms that an item was right on the ISIR, or it is used to correct that\nitem. That is the purpose of verification; continued fact-finding is not necessary.\nHow to Submit Corrections and Updates\nCorrections and updates can be submitted by the student on the FAFSA Submission Summary or the web or by the school\nusing the FAFSA Partner Portal or the Electronic Data Exchange (EDE). In addition to the following information, see also\nVolume 3 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide.\nOnline FAFSA Form. Students and other contributors can correct previously submitted data that was not imported from\nthe IRS.\nFAFSA Partner Portal or EDE. An FAA can submit corrections to a student9s application data using the FAFSA Partner\nPortal. Your school can submit corrections and updates electronically by entering the data manually in the FAFSA Partner\nPortal or by transmitting it to the FAFSA Processing System. However, you cannot update an applicant9s or contributor9s\npersonally identifiable information (PII) or consent and approval using EDE, a third-party software, or the FAFSA Partner\nPortal.\nIf your school isn9t listed on the transaction you want to correct, the student must provide you with the DRN printed on the\nFAFSA Submission Summary. You can then add your school in the next available institution field and gain electronic\naccess to the resulting corrected transaction. If all the fields are filled, the student must add your school code using the\nFAFSA online.\nCorrections and updates sent by a school must be based on reliable documentation in its possession that supports the\nchanges to applicant data or signed documentation from the student or contributor. Examples of reliable documentation\ninclude applications for admission, acceptance letters, course registration information, or academic transcripts. Examples\nof signed documentation from a student or contributor on which corrections and updates may be based include a FAFSA\nSubmission Summary, a copy of the correction or update, student/contributor statement, verification documents, or\ncopies of tax returns or transcripts. These do not have to be wet signatures.\nThe FPS will process the change, send an ISIR to the school, and send the student an updated FAFSA Submission\nNote: Batch corrections and updates may not be available at the time you need to begin making such corrections\nor updates. However, these instructions are provided for future use when this functionality becomes available.\nNote: Some student-initiated corrections have been flagged incorrectly as school-initiated corrections on the\nresulting ISIR transaction. The Department is aware of this defect and working to find a resolution. If your school is\naware of a transaction that is flagged incorrectly as a school-initiated correction, you should notate the student9s\nfile. You are not required to collect documentation unless you have conflicting information or reason to believe the\ninformation on the ISIR transaction is incorrect.",
        "The FPS also checks the application for possible inconsistencies and mistakes. For instance, if a dependent student\nreported the parents9 marital status as married but reported the family size as <2,= the edit checks would catch the\ninconsistency. Even when data is inconsistent, the FPS may be able to calculate an SAI based on assumptions. Students\nwho submit applications online will be able to correct or confirm FPS edits before submitting the application.\nOutput Documents\nAfter processing is complete, the FPS produces output documents 3 the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) and\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary 3 that show the information the student originally provided, the SAI, results of the\neligibility matches, information about aid history, and information about any inconsistencies identified through the FPS\nedits. If the FPS was unable to calculate an SAI, the output record will not show one. The ISIR is made available\nelectronically to the schools the student listed on the FAFSA form (or added later) and their state agency. The FAFSA\nSubmission Summary is made available to the student online or a paper FAFSA Submission Summary is mailed to the\nstudent if the student is unable to access it online. The type of output document depends on the type of record that the\napplicant submitted. Neither the online nor the paper FAFSA Submission Summary will contain FTI. See Volume 6 of the\n2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide for additional information.\nYou will receive an ISIR for the student only if the applicant includes your school on their FAFSA form. If your school is not\nlisted, you can request an ISIR for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal by adding your federal school code if you\nhave the applicant9s Data Release Number (DRN), which authorizes your access to the student9s application information.\nThe DRN appears on the FAFSA Submission Summary, on the FAFSA confirmation page, and in the FAFSA confirmation\nemail.\nYou are required to receive ISIRs and to accept FAFSA Submission Summaries from students, but you cannot require\nstudents to submit FAFSA Submission Summaries to receive aid. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student, your federal\nschool code must be added to their record so that an ISIR is sent to you. We recommend making corrections electronically\nvia the online FAFSA (the student) or the FAFSA Partner Portal (the school); however, students can also use a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary to make corrections. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student who provided a FAFSA Submission\nSummary, you must use the FAFSA Submission Summary to package and disburse the student aid. Again, you must also\nensure that your school code is added to the student9s FPS record (see the <How to Submit Corrections and Updates=\nsection in Chapter 4).\nThe FAFSA Submission Summaries and ISIRs include comment codes and text explaining any questionable results from\nFAFSA processing. Some comment codes also have an associated C Flag, which you must resolve before paying the\nstudent aid. If a student9s FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR contains a comment code that requires resolution, the\nunderlying issue must be resolved before any Title IV funds may be disbursed to the student. For instance, if an applicant\nhas defaulted on a federal student loan, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will note this in several places,\nincluding comments to the applicant and the NSLDS financial aid history page. In addition, if a school disburses Title IV\nfunds to a student with a comment code that requires resolution and the student withdraws before the school has\nresolved the underlying issue, any funds disbursed must be returned to ED since the funds were provided to an otherwise\nineligible student.\nFor other problems, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will show that the FAFSA form has been rejected and no SAI\nhas been calculated. The FAFSA Submission Summary will tell the applicant how to resolve the reject by correcting errors\nor providing consent and approval, signatures, or more information. A complete list of comments, C Flags, reject codes,\nand required resolutions are available in Volume 7 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide.\nA valid output document (ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary) is one on which all the information reported on a student9s\nFAFSA form is accurate and complete as of the date the application is signed.\nValid Output Document\n34 CFR 668.2(b)",
        "Deadlines\nThe application processing cycle typically lasts 21 months, with the FAFSA form opening on October 1 in the year prior to\nthe start of the award year. For the 2025-26 application cycle, the online FAFSA opened for beta testing to a limited\npopulation of applicants on October 1, with the form expected to be available to all applicants by December 1, 2024.\nApplications will be accepted through June 30, 2026.\nThe FPS must receive a student9s online FAFSA information by June 30, 2026. A paper FAFSA form must be legible, and it\nmust be mailed to the Federal Student Aid Programs address listed on the FAFSA form in time for the processor to receive\nit by June 30, 2026. There are no exceptions to these deadlines. An online application received after June 30, 2026, will\nnot be processed.\nA paper application received before the application opens for the award year, or after June 30, 2026, will be returned\nunprocessed with a letter of explanation. If it is signed before and received after the application opens for the award year,\nit will be accepted but the student will receive a rejected FAFSA Submission Summary asking them to date and re-sign the\nFAFSA Submission Summary and return it for processing.\nFor other deadlines pertaining to corrections, changes, disbursements, and verification, see the official deadline notice for\nthe 2025-26 award year. It will provide all the processing deadline dates and will be available in the Knowledge Center\nunder <Federal Registers.= For these deadlines, the date the FPS processed the ISIR transaction is the date the institution\nreceived the ISIR. The processed date is displayed above the SAI on the first page of the FAFSA Submission Summary and\nISIR printout.\nStudents who submit the FAFSA form later in the award year can receive aid for the entire year, including completed\npayment periods, if they were not ineligible at the time. See the section on retroactive disbursements for completed\nperiods in Volume 4, Chapter 2 of the FSA Handbook.\nWebsites for students\nhttps://studentaid.gov/4Higher education portal that contains resources and information about paying for\ncollege.

Students who received a paper FAFSA Submission Summary may make\ncorrections or updates on it, then sign and return it to the FAFSA processor at the address given at the end of the FAFSA\nSubmission Summary. If a contributor9s information is updated or corrected, that contributor also must sign the FAFSA\nSubmission Summary before submitting it for processing.\nStudents who applied electronically are encouraged to return to their Dashboard on StudentAid.gov to make corrections.\nStudents who applied electronically but would like to make corrections via paper may have a paper FAFSA Submission\nSummary mailed to them by calling the FSAIC at 1-800-4-FED-AID and providing their name, SSN, and date of birth,\nthough this feature may not be available until later in the application cycle.\nAdding Schools and Changing a Student9s Address\nAs with other changes, a student can add schools or change their address, email address, or telephone number online or\non a paper FAFSA Submission Summary. A student can also update these items over the phone by calling 1-800-433-3243\nand providing their DRN, though this feature may not be available until later in the application cycle. You can submit\nthose changes for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal if your school is listed on the student9s application, or you\nhave the student9s DRN.\nThe FAFSA form has limited space for a student to list schools that will receive the application data: 10 schools can be\nlisted on the paper application; 20 schools can be listed on the online FAFSA form. If the student wants information sent to\nmore schools, the student can use any of the methods listed previously to replace some or all the original schools. If the\nstudent originally listed 20 schools on the application and then replaced two schools with two new ones, those that were\nreplaced will not receive an ISIR from this correction or any subsequent correction on which they did not appear.\nSignatures\nAny required signatures, such as those on worksheets or on copies of tax returns, must be collected at the time of\nverification4they cannot be collected after the verification deadline for that award year.\nFor verification documentation, a school may collect an electronic signature for an applicant, parent, or spouse if the\nprocess includes an assurance of the identity of the person signing.

The use of their FTI by a Department official to determine an applicant9s eligibility for federal student aid and the\namount for which they are eligible; and\n4. The redisclosure of FTI by the Department to an eligible institution, state higher education agency, or a designated\nscholarship organization (e.g., institutional or state financial aid).\nOnly the Department has the authority to obtain approval and consent for the use and disclosure of FTI for such purposes.\nOur partners (FAAs, advocates, etc.) are not permitted to obtain approval and consent on behalf of FAFSA contributors\n(including parent(s) or spouse) for the use and disclosure of FTI.\nOnce a FAFSA contributor has provided consent and approval for use and disclosure of FTI for a FAFSA cycle (e.g., the\n2025-26 FAFSA cycle), they cannot revoke consent for that cycle. The ability to revoke consent is not needed for FAFSA\npurposes because the FAFSA contributor is providing a one-time consent for a specific tax year and an annual consent is\nrequired for each FAFSA cycle.\nStudents and contributors are not able to view or edit the imported FTI data. This is to enhance security, privacy, and to\nreduce the risk of the misuse of sensitive data. However, you (the financial aid administrator) will be able to see the\ntransferred data on the ISIR. Schools and other partners that receive ISIRs must protect federal student aid information\nprovided to them by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the application, award, and administration of the\nfederal student aid programs as permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA, as amended. In keeping with the\nexpectation that you protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, you must not disclose FTI\nfrom the FAFSA form unless the disclosure and use is permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA 1098h. For additional\ninformation and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34.\nSignatures\nEach student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS\nand (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per\napplication cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a\nprocessed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is\naccurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction\nto contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating\nthat the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their\nFAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect\nthe necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature\nrequirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval. Only the Department can collect a contributor9s\nconsent and approval.\nFederal Tax Information\nThe following data received by the Department from the IRS are considered FTI:\nTax Year (ex. Award year 2025-26 is based on 2023 tax year information from the IRS)\nTax Filing Status\nAdjusted Gross Income (AGI)\nNumber of Exemptions and Number of Dependents\nIncome Earned from Work\nTaxes Paid\nEducational Credits\nUntaxed IRA distributions\nIRA deductions and payments\nTax exempt interest\nUntaxed pension amounts\nSchedule C net profit/loss",

        "Application and Verification Guide\nIntroduction\nThis guide is intended for college financial aid administrators and counselors who help students with the financial aid\nprocess4completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, verifying information, and making\ncorrections and other changes to the information reported on the FAFSA form.\nThroughout the Federal Student Aid Handbook, we use <college,= <school,= and <institution= interchangeably unless a\nmore specific use is given. Similarly, <student,= <applicant,= and <aid recipient= are synonyms. <Parents= in this volume\nrefers to the legal parents of dependent students, and <you= refers to the primary audience of the Handbook: financial aid\nadministrators at colleges. <We= indicates the U.S. Department of Education (the Department, ED), and <federal student\naid= and <Title IV aid= are synonymous terms for the financial aid offered by the Department.\nWe appreciate any comments that you have on the Application and Verification Guide (AVG), as well as all the volumes of\nthe FSA Handbook. We revise the text based on questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please\nreach out to us about how to improve the FSA Handbook through the <Contact Customer Support= feature in our Partner\nConnect Help Center clicking on <FSA Handbook= under the Topic section.\nFAFSA Simplification Act\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a\nsignificant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need\nanalysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the\nFAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for\nEducation (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process.\nChanges From the FUTURE Act\nThe Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data\nexchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate\ncompleting the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data\nRetrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX\neliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information\nreported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered\nverified for Title IV purposes.\nUnlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s\nspouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via\nthe FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid.\nOther Changes\nThroughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references\nhave been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year.\nWhere appropriate, links and publications associated with FSA9s Partner Connect and Knowledge Center have been\nproperly updated. We also removed references to COVID-19 guidance and waivers.\nSome sections were moved to better align topics and assist with narrative flow. Use the search feature to find sections\nthat may have been relocated. The following describes changes made in each chapter.\nChapter 1: The Application Process\nWe removed the <Returning FAFSA Filers= section as FAFSA renewal functionality has been deferred for future cycles.",
        "reconcile the conflicting information and take appropriate action under the specific program requirements (depending on\nthe outcome, funds may have to be returned).\nSubsequent ISIRs\nYou are generally required to review all subsequent transactions for a student for the entire processing year even if you\nverified an earlier transaction. An exception to this requirement is if a later transaction comes in after the student is no\nlonger enrolled at your institution. Review the SAI, C flag, or verification tracking group for changes. Review new\ncomments or NSLDS information that impacts eligibility for aid. Check any updates or corrections. If the SAI has not\nchanged and there are no changes in the C flag, verification tracking group, or NSLDS information, no action is generally\nrequired. If the SAI does change but it either doesn9t affect the amount and type of aid received or the data elements that\nchanged were already verified, no action is required. But if the SAI changes and the pertinent data elements were not\nverified, then you must investigate. Of course, any time the C flag changes or NSLDS data have been modified, you must\nresolve any conflicts.\nDiscrepant Tax Data\nFinancial aid administrators do not need to be tax experts, but there are some issues that even a layperson with basic tax\nlaw information can evaluate. Because conflicting data often involve such information, FAAs must have a fundamental\nunderstanding of relevant tax issues that can impact the need analysis. You are obligated to know (1) whether a person\nwas required to file a tax return and (2) what the correct filing status for a person should be. The IRS9s online Interactive\nTax Assistant can help with these and other issues by walking the user through a series of questions. IRS Publication 17 is\nalso a useful resource.\nResolution of Conflicting Information\nYou must resolve conflicting information prior to disbursing aid to a student enrolled at your school. Even if the conflict\nconcerns a previous award year, you must still investigate it. You have resolved the matter when you have\ndetermined which data are correct; this might simply be confirming that an earlier determination was the right one. You\nmust document your findings and include an explanation that justifies your decision.\nThe verification page on the FSA Assessments site has guidance to help you review your conflicting information\nprocedures; see Activity 1.\nReferral of Fraud Cases\nRequirement to Verify Questionable Data\n34 CFR 668.54(a)(2)\nDiscrepant Tax Data Example\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 7: An FAA notices that a dependent student9s parents, who are married and live\ntogether, have each filed as head of household (which offers a greater tax deduction than filing as single or\nmarried). The FAA must ask if that is the right status. Resolution of the conflict could be the parents refiling and\nsubmitting a copy of the amended return or a reasonable explanation of why there is no conflict under IRS rules."

        "Verification Following Disasters\nThe Dear Colleague Letter GEN-17-08 gives general guidance for awarding aid in federally declared disasters. It states\nthat the Secretary will not enforce the verification requirements during the award year for applicants whose records were\nlost or destroyed because of a disaster if the school has tried to preserve and reconstruct any records. The school must\ndocument when it does not perform verification for this reason and use status code <S= when reporting the disbursement\nof Pell Grants to affected students. Also, the requirement for dependent students to submit a statement signed by a\nparent regarding family size is waived if the parents cannot provide the signature due to the disaster. The school must\nnote why no parent was able to provide the statement.\nSchools that experience a local disaster (rather than a federally declared one) that affects Title IV administration should\nconsult their regional school participation division.\nAcceptable Documentation\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act requires that, wherever possible, the Department use data received directly from the IRS to\ncalculate a student9s SAI and Pell Grant award. The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education\nAct (FUTURE Act) requires the Department of Education to access tax information held by the IRS pertaining to FAFSA\napplicants4and, where applicable, their parents and spouses4through a secure method: the FUTURE Act Direct Data\nExchange (FA-DDX). The FUTURE Act amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to mandate the disclosure of FTI directly\nfrom the IRS to the Department with an individual9s consent and approval. The FUTURE Act also made providing consent\nand approval for the exchange of FTI a requirement for receiving federal student aid.\nApplicants and contributors will be required to provide consent and approval to retrieve FTI directly from the IRS. When\nFTI is received from the IRS via the FA-DDX, the FTI received is considered verified and no additional documentation is\nnecessary. As a result, the FA-DDX is the fastest, easiest, and most secure method of meeting income and tax verification\nrequirements. The September 4, 2024 Federal Register Notice gives the documentation required for verifying 2025-26\napplication data, which depends on the item verified, as explained in this section.\nIf you use a verification document, be sure that it is signed, that all required sections are completed, and that any\nrelevant tax or alternative documents are attached. Copies of original documents are acceptable. An original signature on\nan original document, an original signature on a copy of a document, and a copy of a document with an original signature\non it are all valid signatures, unless specifically noted in this chapter. If a copy of the tax return is used, the filer (or at\nleast one of the filers of a joint return) must sign it or the tax preparer must provide their name and SSN, EIN, or PTIN.\nSuggested Verification Text\nThe Department has developed suggested text that you may use to create a verification document and to verify non-tax\nitems, such as family size. To review the suggested text for 2025-26, please see Dear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10. The\nsuggested text fulfills verification requirements, but schools do not have to use it, except as noted below. Instead, they\nmay develop and use their own (or someone else9s) text, forms, documents, statements, and certifications that are\nspecific to the items required to be verified for a particular student or group of students at the school. However, schools\nthey tried to locate their estranged spouse. The school determines that the student doesn9t need to verify their\nspouse9s tax and income information. However, the student must still verify their own information. The school\nmay also choose to use professional judgment to remove the spouse9s information from the student9s FAFSA form.\nVerification Exclusions\n34 CFR 668.54(b)",
        "Indicators for Schedules A, B, D, E, F, H\nIRS response code\nIn some limited circumstances, the student or contributor may need to manually provide data if it is unavailable through\nthe FA-DDX or does not reflect their current personal circumstances. In these cases, manually entered data will be used in\nthe SAI calculation. For example, a contributor would be required to manually report income and tax data if they were\nmarried and filed their 2023 U.S. tax return jointly with their spouse but are now divorced.\nIRS Response Codes\nThe IRS will provide one of the following response codes for each contributor, and they will appear on a student9s ISIR.\nCode\nIndication\n200\nUsable FTI data retrieved successfully\n214\nNo return on file\n203\n206\n212\nNo usable FTI data retrieved\nThe IRS provides a response code value of <200= when the IRS has data and it was successfully shared with FSA for\ninclusion on the applicant9s FAFSA form. Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler.\nIRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution.\nContributors\n<Contributor= refers to anyone who is required to provide information, consent, and approval, and a signature on the\nFAFSA form. The FAFSA form is organized by contributor. Each contributor will complete their own section of the form\nwhich contains specific questions and instructions pertaining to that contributor. The guidance in this chapter\nsupplements those instructions and explains why some of the questions are needed on the FAFSA form.\nThe following sections discuss the questions found within each contributor section on the FAFSA form. The parents\nmentioned are the legal parents of dependent students. The numbers in parentheses are for the items as they appear on\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary, ISIR, paper (PDF) FAFSA, and FAFSA Partner Portal. The FAFSA form is considered a\n<snapshot= of the family9s information as of the date the application is signed and it can be updated only in certain\ncircumstances and only for certain items. See Chapter 4 for more information about updating a FAFSA form.\nContributor: Student\nThis section consists of 24 questions related to the student.\nStudent Identity Information (1)\nThis question requests the name, date of birth, and Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification\nNumber (ITIN) of the student contributor. The name, with other identifying information, is used for several data matches.",
        "2. The disclosure of their FTI by the IRS to the Department;\n3. The use of their FTI by a Department official to determine an applicant9s eligibility for federal student aid and the\namount for which they are eligible; and\n4. The redisclosure of FTI by the Department to an eligible institution, state higher education agency, or a designated\nscholarship organization (e.g., institutional or state financial aid).\nOnly the Department has the authority to obtain approval and consent for the use and disclosure of FTI for such purposes.\nOur partners (FAAs, advocates, etc.) are not permitted to obtain approval and consent on behalf of FAFSA contributors\n(including parent(s) or spouse) for the use and disclosure of FTI.\nOnce a FAFSA contributor has provided consent and approval for use and disclosure of FTI for a FAFSA cycle (e.g., the\n2025-26 FAFSA cycle), they cannot revoke consent for that cycle. The ability to revoke consent is not needed for FAFSA\npurposes because the FAFSA contributor is providing a one-time consent for a specific tax year and an annual consent is\nrequired for each FAFSA cycle.\nStudents and contributors are not able to view or edit the imported FTI data. This is to enhance security, privacy, and to\nreduce the risk of the misuse of sensitive data. However, you (the financial aid administrator) will be able to see the\ntransferred data on the ISIR. Schools and other partners that receive ISIRs must protect federal student aid information\nprovided to them by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the application, award, and administration of the\nfederal student aid programs as permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA, as amended. In keeping with the\nexpectation that you protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, you must not disclose FTI\nfrom the FAFSA form unless the disclosure and use is permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA 1098h. For additional\ninformation and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34.\nSignatures\nEach student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS\nand (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per\napplication cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a\nprocessed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is\naccurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction\nto contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating\nthat the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their\nFAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect\nthe necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature\nrequirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval. Only the Department can collect a contributor9s\nconsent and approval.\nFederal Tax Information\nThe following data received by the Department from the IRS are considered FTI:\nTax Year (ex. Award year 2025-26 is based on 2023 tax year information from the IRS)\nTax Filing Status\nAdjusted Gross Income (AGI)\nNumber of Exemptions and Number of Dependents\nIncome Earned from Work\nTaxes Paid\nEducational Credits\nUntaxed IRA distributions\nIRA deductions and payments\nTax exempt interest\nUntaxed pension amounts\nSchedule C net profit/loss",
        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3.\nThe easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported. However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form.\nFUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form.\nConsent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper).\nTo provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department.\nFAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor."

If they submit a paper (PDF) FAFSA form without an SSN, the FAFSA\nform will be returned unprocessed. Students will be unable to submit a FAFSA form electronically without an account\nusername and password, which requires an SSN (except students who are citizens one of the Freely Associated States).\nThe student must contact the local SSA office to get an SSN or to find out what the number is if they lost their Social\nSecurity card. Go to https://www.ssa.gov/number-card for more information.\nIf the student9s name, date of birth, or SSN does not match with the Social Security Administration, the student typically\nneeds to resolve the issue with the SSA. If the information submitted is correct, the student must contact SSA to update\nits records. After the student receives confirmation that SSA has corrected its records, the student must contact the\nFederal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) and ask them to manually sync their data with SSA. Alternatively, if the\nstudent notifies the school that they received confirmation from SSA, the FAA may update the Resend to Matches field to\n<Y= in the FAFSA Partner Portal and submit it as a correction so the transaction can go back to SSA for an updated match\nflag. Records sent for rematching will continue to receive this match flag until SSA updates its database.\nStudents who enter their name, date of birth, or SSN incorrectly should log in to StudentAid.gov and update their\ninformation in Account Settings. The record will be resent to SSA for matching. Once SSA verifies the account, the\nstudent should update their FAFSA form by submitting a correction.\nStudent Contact Information (2)\nThis is the student9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address, with three exceptions:\nStudents under the age of 13 should not provide an email address as FSA cannot communicate with them\nelectronically.

This may be the physical address\nof the facility they are in, the address of the school (if permitted by the school), or a central processing facility used\nby the facility for mail distribution. If a prison ID number is required by the facility for the applicant to receive mail,\nthe applicant should list that at the end of the address field. If an incarcerated student is released, they should also\nupdate their address in their StudentAid.gov account or on their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nHomeless students should use a mailing address where they can reliably receive mail. That can be the address of a\nrelative or friend who has given them permission to use it, or it can be their school9s address if they have contacted\nthe school for permission and instructions on how mail they receive at the school will reach them. As soon as\nhomeless students have more permanent housing, they should update their address in their StudentAid.gov account\nor on their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nIf the student provides an email address, they should get an email with a link to their online FAFSA Submission Summary\nwithin one to three days after the FPS receives the completed application. The Department will also use this email address\nto correspond with the student regarding their application.\nStudent Current Marital Status (3)\nThis is marital status <as of today= 3 the day the application is signed. Marital status cannot be projected. It can be\nupdated in limited circumstances; see Chapter 4.\nA student who is only engaged should select <single (never married)= unless they wait until after their marriage date to\ncomplete the FAFSA form. A student in a relationship that meets the criteria for common-law marriage in their state of\nlegal residence should select <married= and will be considered independent. A student who is separated from their spouse\nshould select <separated= and will be considered a dependent student for FAFSA purposes, unless they meet other criteria\nto be considered an independent student.\nStudent College or Career School Plans (4)\nStudents should answer this question based on the degree or certificate program they will be working on at the start of",

Other information not excluded\nmust still be verified according to all other requirements.\nYou don9t have to verify FAFSA information of a student in the following situations:\nDeath of the student. You don9t have to continue verification if you made an interim disbursement and the student\ndied before verification was completed. You cannot make any additional disbursements, except for FWS funds\nalready earned, to any of the student9s beneficiaries. You cannot originate or disburse their Direct Subsidized Loan.\nFurther, you cannot consider any interim disbursement you made of Pell or FSEOG funds or provisional FWS\nemployment to be an overpayment.\nNot an aid recipient. The student won9t receive Title IV aid for reasons other than a failure to complete verification.\nThis includes being ineligible for that aid and withdrawing without receiving it.\nThe applicant is eligible to receive only unsubsidized student financial assistance. However, students\nselected for V4 or V5 verification should complete it in accordance with the answer to DOC-Q18 on the Program\nIntegrity Questions and Answers 3 Verification page.\nApplicant verified by another school. The student completed verification for the current award year at another\nschool before transferring. Their FAFSA data must be the same as it was at the previous school, and you must get a\nletter from that school stating that it verified the student's application and providing the transaction number of the\npertinent valid ISIR.\nPost enrollment. The student was selected for verification after ceasing to be enrolled at your school, they do not\nintend to reenroll for the award year, and no further (including late) disbursements will be made.\nUnless you have reason to believe it is inaccurate, you don9t have to verify the reported FAFSA information of the parents\nof a dependent student if any of the following apply (including in cases where there is only one parent):\nBoth parents are mentally incapacitated.\nBoth parents, or the custodial parent, has died.\nThe parents are residing in a country other than the United States and can9t be contacted by normal means.\nThe parents can9t be located because the student does not have and cannot get their contact information.\nUnless you have reason to believe it is inaccurate, you don9t have to verify the reported FAFSA information of the spouse\nof an independent student if any of the following apply:\nThe spouse has died.\nThe spouse is mentally incapacitated.\nThe spouse is residing in a country other than the United States and can9t be contacted by normal means.\nThe spouse can9t be located because the student does not have and cannot get their contact information.\nVerification Exemption Example\nAVG, Chapter 4, Example 1: A student is enrolled in their local community college and their application is\nselected for verification. The student provides their spouse9s information on the application but now explains that\nthe spouse recently moved out and is unreachable. The student provides their school documents to show that",
        "However, there will be instances where manual entry of tax information will be necessary.\nThis information comes directly from the 2023 federal tax return of the parent9s (and parent9s spouse if married and filed\njointly with their current spouse). See the discussion of tax return data in the <Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)=\nquestion for a list of data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX or be manually entered by the parent.\nAnnual Child Support Received (39)\nAnnual child support received is included as an asset of the recipient in the SAI formula.

Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nA dependent student with a single parent now has a complete FAFSA ready for submission. A dependent student with\nmarried parents who filed their 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse will need to provide the parent9s spouse9s\nidentity and contact information. If all required information is provided and the FAFSA form is submitted, the student will\nreceive an email confirmation. The parent will see an abbreviated confirmation, letting them know that the form is\ncomplete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide an email address will receive email notification\nwhen their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who do not provide\nan email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nContributor: Parent Spouse or Partner\nThis section consists of five questions related to the spouse or partner of a parent of a dependent student. If the student9s\nparent is married, the spouse9s information is always required on the FAFSA form. If the student9s parent is unmarried and\nliving with a partner, the partner9s information is only required on the FAFSA form if the partner is also the student9s legal\nparent.\nThe parent spouse or partner is only a required contributor on the FAFSA form if the parent is either (1) married or\nremarried and did not file taxes jointly with their current spouse in 2023, or (2) unmarried and living with the student9s\nother legal parent. If the parent contributor is completing the FAFSA form online and the parent9s spouse is identified as a\nrequired contributor, the parent will be prompted to enter the parent spouse9s or partner9s identity information (name,\nSocial Security number, date of birth, and email address) to invite them to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The\nparent spouse or partner will be notified by email that they have been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form.\nThe spouse or partner should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and password to access the student9s\nFAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the parent9s spouse is not a required contributor, the parent will\nenter the same identifying information and email address, but the parent9s spouse will not be invited to contribute to the\nstudent9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent9s spouse or partner complete the",

These applicants can complete a paper (PDF)\nFAFSA form designated specifically for incarcerated applicants, available on the Prison Education Programs resource page\nof the FSA Knowledge Center.\nThe mailing address for the Incarcerated Applicant FAFSA form is printed on the first page of the form under <Mail Your\nFAFSA® Form=. The address changes annually and differs from the general FAFSA form mailing address, so use the\naddress printed on the associated year9s Incarcerated Applicant FAFSA form. You must mail all fillable pages of the form\n(pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to the applicant. Extra postage will be\nrequired due to the size and/or weight of the mailing.\nFAFSA Partner Portal\nThe FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP) replaced FAA Access to CPS Online beginning with the 2024-25 award year. FSA\ndecommissioned the FAA Access site after the 2023324 application cycle closed.\nThe FAFSA Partner Portal removed the ability for a financial aid administrator (FAA) to initiate a new application on behalf\nof a student. This is due to the requirement in the FUTURE Act that all FAFSA form contributors (including students,\nspouses, and parents) must provide their consent to disclose information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\napproval to retrieve and use certain Federal Tax Information (FTI). FAAs cannot provide consent and approval on behalf of\nany other person. Therefore, you will not be able to use the FPP to start and submit a new FAFSA form on an applicant9s\nbehalf. However, you can make certain corrections or updates.\nTranslation Assistance\nThe FAFSA form is available in English and Spanish. If you need assistance completing the form in English or Spanish\ncontact the FSAIC at 1-800-433-3243. Translation assistance in additional languages is available by calling 1-833-610-\n2590 and pressing <7= to request a specific language.\nAccount Username and Password (FSA ID)\nThe account username and password, also known as the FSA ID, is used to access a person9s StudentAid.gov account. It\nserves as an electronic signature and a digital identifier to allow access to various ED systems and services for students,\nspouses of students, parents, or spouses/partners of parents. Therefore, each individual must create their own account\nand should not share their login credentials with anyone, including FAAs. Users can create an account online at\nStudentAid.gov quickly and securely. See Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-123 for additional information on\ncreating a StudentAid.gov account for individuals without a Social Security number.\nEach person who provides data in the online FAFSA form must have an account username and password to access the\nform. In the past, a Social Security number (SSN) was required to create a StudentAid.gov account. Starting with the\n2024325 award year, all individuals4even those without an SSN4can create a StudentAid.gov account. Persons with an\nSSN will still have their information verified by the Social Security Administration (SSA), while those without an SSN will\nuse the TransUnion® knowledge-based identity verification process described below.\nThe account username and password are created in real-time so that the student or other contributor can use it\nimmediately to enter the FAFSA form. Pending StudentAid.gov accounts with an SSN will be sent to the SSA to be\nmatched. Only those accounts with a successful match (<SSA Match Status= value of 4 on the Institutional Student\nNote: There will be two active portals that coincide with the two open FAFSA application cycles. The links below\nare specific to the application cycle. Be sure to use the correct portal for the applicable award year.\n2024-25 FAFSA Partner Portal - https://fafsa.partnerportal.ed.gov\n2025-26 FAFSA Partner Portal - https://fafsa.partnerportal-2526.ed.gov\nIf the Department is able to consolidate to one portal in future cycles, we will provide an updated link."

      "question": "How is the definition of a parent on the FAFSA relevant to the completion of the form for students with unmarried biological parents living together?",
      "response": "The definition of a parent on the FAFSA is relevant for students with unmarried biological parents living together because it clarifies who should be considered a parent and therefore report financial information on the form. Specifically, the FAFSA considers a biological or adoptive parent, or a person determined by the state to be a parent (e.g., listed on a birth certificate), as a parent. \n\nFor students with unmarried biological parents living together, both parents are typically considered parents if they are living together and both qualify under this definition. They would each be required to complete their portion of the FAFSA, report their income and assets, and provide their identifying and contact information. The form accounts for their marital status—whether they are married, unmarried and living together, or divorced/never married—and guides the student on which parent(s) to list based on financial support provided over the past year.\n\nIf both biological parents are unmarried but living together, they are both considered parents and are expected to report their financial information, with their marital status noted as \"unmarried and living together.\" This ensures that the FAFSA accurately reflects the household’s financial situation and complies with federal requirements.\n\nIn summary, understanding that both biological parents living together are considered parents helps ensure the student completes the FAFSA correctly by including both parents’ information when appropriate, which directly impacts their financial aid eligibility determination.",

        "This question asks if a 2023 IRS Form 1040 or 1040-NR was (or will be) completed. It also asks about income earned in a\nforeign country or if the student spouse filed a tax return in a U.S. territory. See the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)=\nquestion for additional information.\nStudent Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28)\nThis information comes directly from the student spouse9s 2023 tax return. See the discussion of tax return data in the\n<Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX or be\nmanually entered by the student spouse. Unlike the student, the student9s spouse will not be asked to report taxable\ncollege grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits. If the student or spouse had an amount to report, the student should\nhave reported the joint total in the student section. The spouse will also not be asked about receipt of the earned income\ntax credit (EITC). Receipt of the EITC is used to determine if the student (or parent) is a single parent. If the student (or\nparent) is married, they are not a single parent, which makes it unnecessary to ask the spouse about the EITC.\nStudent Spouse Consent, Approval, and Signature (29)\nEvery student spouse contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The student spouse contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the\nIRS.\nApproval 3 The student spouse contributor must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may\nreceive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The student spouse contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their signature on the\nonline FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nMarried, independent students who did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete\nFAFSA ready for submission. The student will receive an email confirmation that the form was submitted. The spouse will\nsee an abbreviated confirmation that the form is complete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide\nan email address will receive email notification when their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA\nSubmission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission\nSummary.\nContributor: Parent\nThis section consists of 12 questions related to the parent of a dependent student.\nDependent students will always have at least one parent contributor. If the student is completing the FAFSA form online,\nthey will be prompted to enter their parent9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and email\naddress) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The parent will be notified by email that they have been invited\nto contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The parent should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and\npassword to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s parent is married\nand filed their 2023 taxes jointly with their current spouse, only one parent contributor is required. If the student9s parent\nis either (1) married or remarried, or (2) unmarried and living together, and did not file their 2023 taxes jointly with their\ncurrent spouse or partner, the parent9s spouse or partner will be a required contributor on the student9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent complete the parent section.\nWho Counts as a Parent on the FAFSA?\nIn most cases, it9s clear who the parents are. A parent is a biological or adoptive parent, or a person that the state has\ndetermined to be a parent (for example, when a state allows another person9s name to be listed as a parent on a birth\ncertificate). A stepparent is considered a parent if married to a biological or adoptive parent and if the student counts\nthem in their family size. Biological and adoptive parents who are unmarried and living together select that as their\nmarital status, and both report their information on the FAFSA form.",
        "However, a stepparent who did not adopt the student cannot be the sole parent for determining dependency status. If one\nparent dies, the student is still a dependent of the remaining biological or adoptive parent, not the stepparent.\nIf parents are divorced or never married and not living together, the parent on the FAFSA form should be the parent who\nprovided more than 50% of the financial support for the student during the last 12 months. This may be different from the\nparent the student lived with during that same period. If one parent pays child support and/or alimony to the other parent,\nthe amount paid counts for the payer when determining which parent provided more than 50% of the student9s financial\nsupport and is a required contributor on the FAFSA form. Once the parent who provides more than 50% of the financial\nsupport for the student has been determined, that parent (and their current spouse, if applicable) should report their\nfinancial information on the student9s FAFSA form as a contributor.\nIf neither parent provided more than 50% of the financial support for the student (including when neither parent provided\nsupport for the student) during the last 12 months, the parent with the greater income and assets is a required\ncontributor on the FAFSA form. Once the parent with the greater income and assets has been determined, that parent\n(and their current spouse, if applicable) should report their financial information on the student9s FAFSA form.\nNote: It is not typical that a student will receive support from both parents exactly equally. Usually, you can determine\nthat the student received more than half support from one of the parents.\nA foster parent or a legal guardian is not treated as a parent for Title IV purposes. If at any time since the age of 13 both\nstudent9s parents were dead (and they did not have an adoptive parent at that time) or the student was in foster care,\nthey are independent. If the student is now or was when they became an adult an emancipated minor or in legal\nguardianship, the student is independent.\nIf a student is living with their grandparents or other relatives, their data should not be reported on the FAFSA form as\nparental data unless they have adopted the student.\nParent Identity Information (30)\nLike the student, the parent identity information should match what appears on their social security card. If the parent\nSurviving Parent and Stepparent Example\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 9: A dependent student9s parents divorced when the student was five years old. The\nstudent9s mother remarried, and the student lived with her and the student9s stepfather, who did not adopt the\nstudent. The student9s mother died last year, but the student9s biological father is still living. The student does not\nmeet any of the criteria to be independent. Because the student9s biological father is the only surviving parent,\nthe student needs to report the biological father9s information on the FAFSA form, even if the student is still living\nwith and being supported by the stepfather.\nStudent Living With Relatives Example\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 10: A student9s father is dead, and the student9s mother can9t support the student,\nso the student is living with their grandparents. The student9s mother doesn9t pay any money for the student9s\nsupport. The student doesn9t meet any of the independence criteria, so the student must provide parental\ninformation. Because the student9s grandparents haven9t adopted the student, they are not the student9s parents.\nThe student will have to provide information about their mother on the form unless there are unusual\ncircumstances that would warrant a dependency override or the student may elect to receive only unsubsidized\nloans. See Chapter 5 for additional guidance on unusual circumstances.",

Unborn children should not be included\nin the family size, though the family size can be updated if the child is born and will receive more than half of their\nsupport from the parent (and spouse or partner) during the award year.\nOther persons who live with and receive more than half their support from the parent (and spouse or partner) and\nwill receive more than half support for the entire award year.\nNumber in College (35)\nWhile number in college is no longer used to calculate a student9s SAI, the FAFSA Simplification Act requires the question\nto be included on the FAFSA form. Schools can use the information provided to perform a special circumstance adjustment\nfor a student. See <Professional Judgment= in Chapter 5: Special Cases of this volume for additional information.\nThe student is always included in the number in college. Also included are those in the family size who are or will be\nenrolled at least half time during the award year in a degree or certificate program at a Title IV-eligible school.\nFederal Benefits Received (36)\nA student may be eligible to have their and their parents9 assets excluded from the SAI calculation if they (or someone in\ntheir family) received one (or more) federal benefits during the 2023 or 2024 calendar years. See the <Federal Benefits",

A dependent student with\nmarried parents who filed their 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse will need to provide the parent9s spouse9s\nidentity and contact information. If all required information is provided and the FAFSA form is submitted, the student will\nreceive an email confirmation. The parent will see an abbreviated confirmation, letting them know that the form is\ncomplete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide an email address will receive email notification\nwhen their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who do not provide\nan email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nContributor: Parent Spouse or Partner\nThis section consists of five questions related to the spouse or partner of a parent of a dependent student. If the student9s\nparent is married, the spouse9s information is always required on the FAFSA form. If the student9s parent is unmarried and\nliving with a partner, the partner9s information is only required on the FAFSA form if the partner is also the student9s legal\nparent.\nThe parent spouse or partner is only a required contributor on the FAFSA form if the parent is either (1) married or\nremarried and did not file taxes jointly with their current spouse in 2023, or (2) unmarried and living with the student9s\nother legal parent. If the parent contributor is completing the FAFSA form online and the parent9s spouse is identified as a\nrequired contributor, the parent will be prompted to enter the parent spouse9s or partner9s identity information (name,\nSocial Security number, date of birth, and email address) to invite them to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The\nparent spouse or partner will be notified by email that they have been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form.\nThe spouse or partner should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and password to access the student9s\nFAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the parent9s spouse is not a required contributor, the parent will\nenter the same identifying information and email address, but the parent9s spouse will not be invited to contribute to the\nstudent9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent9s spouse or partner complete the"

      "response": "The FAFSA form addresses situations where a parent's tax filing status is unique, such as not filing a U.S. tax return due to foreign income or other reasons, by providing specific instructions for manual entry and categorization. If a parent has not filed a U.S. tax return because they earned income outside the U.S., in a foreign country, or from an international organization and was not required to file, they should answer \"No\" to the question about filing a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR. They will then be asked to select a reason for not filing, such as earning foreign income or working for an international organization. \n\nIn these cases, they are required to manually input their income and tax information into the FAFSA form by converting foreign currency amounts into U.S. dollars and entering the corresponding data in the appropriate fields. The form explicitly states that individuals with foreign income or who worked for an international organization but are not required to file U.S. taxes must manually enter their income data, as they cannot use the automated data transfer system (FA-DDX) for foreign tax returns. \n\nThis approach ensures that the FAFSA can accurately assess the financial situation of students with parents who have unique or non-U.S. tax filing statuses, even if a U.S. tax return was not filed.",

        "Dependent students who answer <no= to the first to parts of the question will still need to provide answers to questions\nabout their assets if their parents are required to provide financial information.\nIndependent students are automatically eligible for a Maximum Pell Grant if they (and their spouse, if married) are not\nrequired to file a 2023 federal tax return. Such students will be assigned an SAI of -1,500 and will not be required to\nprovide any further financial information on the FAFSA form.\nIndividuals who were married and filed jointly with the IRS and are no longer married to the spouse on the applicable tax\nreturn, and/or who have married a different spouse, will be required to manually enter their income and tax information.\nSee the <Joint Return Filers Who Are No Longer Married= section in Chapter 4 for additional information on separating tax\nreturn and income information.\nIndividuals who only file foreign tax returns will also be unable to use the FA-DDX since it does not link to foreign tax\nauthorities. They will instead need to manually input their income and tax data by converting foreign currency to U.S.\ndollars and entering the resulting amounts in the comparable fields from U.S. tax returns.\nPuerto Rico and Other U.S. Territory Residents\nSome individuals who reside in Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory may use an IRS Form 1040 or 1040-NR but file their\ntaxes with their local tax authority, not the IRS. These individuals should answer <No= to the question <Did or will the\nstudent file a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR?= and <Yes= to the subsequent question to indicate they filed a tax return\nwith Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory.\nAdditionally, some individuals who live and work in Puerto Rico may file two tax returns 3 one with the IRS and one with\nthe Puerto Rico tax authority. If they are filing electronically and FTI is available via the FA-DDX, only their tax information\nfiled with the IRS will be imported to the FAFSA form. They will not be able to manually enter the information from their\ntax return filed with Puerto Rico. If the FAA is aware of this dual filing scenario, the FAA should evaluate the applicant9s\ninformation and determine if the information from the Puerto Rico tax return should replace the information imported\nfrom the IRS. FAAs who determine that the information from the Puerto Rico tax return should be on the FAFSA should\nupdate the appropriate FAFSA fields and set the <Professional Judgment= indicator. While this is not a PJ, the changes to\nthe FAFSA application system require this work-around to override the IRS-transferred FTI with the manually updated FTI.\nFSA is working on system changes for future application cycles to allow for these updates without setting the <Professional\nJudgment= indicator. See Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-118 for additional information.\nNontax Filers, Foreign Countries, and International Organizations\nIn some countries the tax system does not operate as it does in the U.S., and people in those countries can earn a\nsubstantial amount of income and pay taxes without having to file a return. These individuals should answer <No= to the\nquestion <Did or will the student file a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR?= and <Yes= to the subsequent question to indicate\nthey earned income in a foreign country. While these individuals did not file taxes in the U.S., they are not eligible for an\nautomatic Maximum Pell Grant and must manually enter income and tax information.\nIn some instances, employees of certain international organizations, such as the United Nations, the International\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank, and others, might not be required to file a return. These individuals should answer <No=\nto the question <Did or will the student file a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR?= and <Yes= to the subsequent question to\nindicate they worked for an international organization. Like foreign non-filers described above, these individuals will be\nrequired to manually enter income and tax information, as they are not eligible to receive an automatic Maximum Pell\nGrant as a non-filer.\nIndividuals who earn income in a foreign country or as an employee of an international organization (e.g., World Bank,\nUnited Nations, and International Monetary Fund) and are not required to file a tax return should fill out the FAFSA form in\nthe following way using U.S. dollars:\nFor filing status, select <Single= if you9re single or <Married filing separately= if you9re married.\nFor AGI, include all wages, dividends, capital gains, business income, retirement distributions, and other income on\nwhich you may have paid taxes.\nFor income tax paid, include any income taxes you paid on income in your AGI.

        "Received (18)= question for a list of these federal benefits.\nParent Tax Filing Status (37)\nThis question asks if the parent filed (or will file) a 2023 IRS 1040 or 1040-NR. If the answer is <no=, the parent will be\nasked to select one of the following reasons for not filing:\n1. The parent filed or will file a tax return with Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory.\n2. The parent filed or will file a foreign tax return.\n3. The parent either earned income in a foreign country but did not and will not file a foreign tax return, or worked for\nan international organization and was not required to report income on any tax return.\n4. The parent, even though they earned income in the U.S., did not and will not file a U.S. tax return because their\nincome was below the filing threshold.\n5. The parent did not and will not file a U.S. tax return for reasons other than low income.\n6. The parent did not and will not file any tax return because they did not earn any income or they were not required to\nfile under the Internal Revenue Code.\nThe purpose of these questions is to determine if a parent was either (1) required to file a 2023 U.S. federal tax return and\ndid not or (2) has income from a foreign country that must be manually entered on the FAFSA form.\nA dependent student will be automatically eligible for a Maximum Pell Grant if their parent (and parent9s spouse or\npartner) is subject to the U.S. Tax Code but is not required to file a 2023 U.S. federal tax return. The student will be\nassigned an SAI of -1,500 and will not be required to provide any further financial information on the FAFSA form.\nFinally, married parents are asked if they filed their 2023 tax return with their current spouse. Individuals who were\nmarried and filed jointly with the IRS and are no longer married to the spouse on the applicable tax return, or who have\nmarried a different spouse, will be required to manually enter their income and tax information. See the <Joint Return\nFilers Who Are No Longer Married= section in Chapter 4 for additional information on separating tax return and income\ninformation.\nIndividuals who only file foreign tax returns will also be unable to use the FA-DDX since it does not link to foreign tax\nauthorities. They will instead need to manually input their income and tax data by converting foreign currency to U.S.\ndollars and entering the resulting amounts in the comparable fields from U.S. tax returns. See the <Student Tax Filing\nStatus (19)= question for additional information.\nIf the parent indicates they earned income in a foreign country but did not file a foreign tax return, or worked for an\ninternational organization, such as the United Nations, World Bank, or International Monetary Fund (option 3), they will\nneed to manually input their income and tax data, similar to individuals who file foreign tax returns. See <Non-tax filers,\nforeign countries, and international organizations= under <Student Tax Filing Status (19)= for additional guidance.\nIf a parent indicates they did not file a U.S. tax return for reasons other than low income (option 5), you should treat this\nas conflicting information and request documentation to resolve it, which may include requiring the individual to file a tax\nreturn and present sufficient documentation of filing to you.\nIf a parent indicates they did not file any tax return because they did not earn any income (option 6) and their state of\nlegal residence is a foreign country, you must determine if the parent has foreign untaxed income that, when included in\nthe SAI calculation, impacts a student9s Pell Grant eligibility. Comment code 303 on the student9s ISIR should prompt you\nto request additional documentation. If your inquiry into the parents9 financial situation shows that the student might be\neligible for less or no Pell grant funds, you may use PJ to account for the parents9 untaxed income and assets, similar to\nthe action you might take when there is a substantial foreign earned income exclusion on a U.S. tax return that can affect\na student9s Pell eligibility.\nParent 2023 Tax Return Information (38)\nFor U.S. tax filers, much of the information in Question 38 will be transferred directly from the IRS via the FA-DDX.",
        "Chapter 5\nSpecial Cases\nThere are unique situations where you will need to exercise your discretion as a financial aid administrator: when\nmodifying data used to calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI), adjusting a student9s cost of attendance (COA), performing\ndependency overrides, resolving conflicting information, reporting cases of fraud, and determining a student to be an\nunaccompanied homeless youth.\nThe following special cases are discussed in further detail in this chapter:\nYou may choose to exercise professional judgment (PJ) to adjust components of a student9s COA or the data that\ndetermine a student9s SAI to account for a student9s special circumstances.\nYou might also choose to exercise PJ to account for a student9s unusual circumstances that warrant making a\ndependent student an independent student.\nYou may need to determine if a student should be classified as an unaccompanied homeless youth.\nYou may need to resolve a discrepancy after receiving conflicting information for a student.\nIn some cases, you may suspect that a student or employee has fraudulently obtained federal funds and you must\nreport them to the Department.\nProfessional Judgment\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act (the Act) distinguishes between different categories of professional judgment by amending\nsection 479A of the HEA.\nSpecial Circumstances refer to the financial situations (loss of a job, etc.) that justify an aid administrator adjusting\ndata elements in the COA or in the SAI calculation.\nUnusual Circumstances refer to the conditions that justify an aid administrator making an adjustment to a\nstudent9s dependency status based on a unique situation (e.g., human trafficking, refugee or asylee status, parental\nabuse or abandonment, incarceration), more commonly referred to as a dependency override.\nA student may have both a special circumstance and an unusual circumstance. Financial aid administrators (FAAs) may\nmake adjustments that are appropriate to each student9s situation with appropriate documentation. See Dear Colleague\nLetter GEN-22-15 for additional guidance and discussion of the changes made by the FAFSA Simplification Act.\nSpecial Circumstances\nAn FAA may use PJ on a case-by-case basis to adjust the components of a student9s cost of attendance or the data used to\ncalculate their SAI. This adjustment is valid only at the school making the change.\nThe law gives some examples of special circumstances that may be considered (HEA Sec. 479A):\nChange in employment status, income, or assets;\nChange in housing status (e.g., homelessness);\nTuition expenses at an elementary or secondary school;\nAdditional family members enrolled in college;\nMedical, dental, or nursing home expenses not covered by insurance;\nChild or dependent care expenses;\nSevere disability of the student or other member of the student9s household; and\nOther changes or adjustments that impact the student9s costs or ability to pay for college.\nThis is not an exhaustive list. You may use your discretion to make appropriate, reasonable adjustments to reflect a\nstudent9s situation more accurately. You may also use your discretion to deny a student9s request for adjustment.\nHowever, you may not maintain a policy to deny all requests for special circumstance adjustments. Your institution must\ndevelop policies and a process for reviewing requests for professional judgment. Additionally, your institution must\npublicly disclose that students may request an adjustment based on special circumstances. This could include (but is not",
        "This question asks if a 2023 IRS Form 1040 or 1040-NR was (or will be) completed. It also asks about income earned in a\nforeign country or if the student spouse filed a tax return in a U.S. territory. See the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)=\nquestion for additional information.\nStudent Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28)\nThis information comes directly from the student spouse9s 2023 tax return.

Unlike the student, the student9s spouse will not be asked to report taxable\ncollege grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits. If the student or spouse had an amount to report, the student should\nhave reported the joint total in the student section. The spouse will also not be asked about receipt of the earned income\ntax credit (EITC). Receipt of the EITC is used to determine if the student (or parent) is a single parent. If the student (or\nparent) is married, they are not a single parent, which makes it unnecessary to ask the spouse about the EITC.\nStudent Spouse Consent, Approval, and Signature (29)\nEvery student spouse contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The student spouse contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the\nIRS.\nApproval 3 The student spouse contributor must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may\nreceive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The student spouse contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their signature on the\nonline FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nMarried, independent students who did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete\nFAFSA ready for submission. The student will receive an email confirmation that the form was submitted. The spouse will\nsee an abbreviated confirmation that the form is complete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide\nan email address will receive email notification when their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA\nSubmission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission\nSummary.\nContributor: Parent\nThis section consists of 12 questions related to the parent of a dependent student.\nDependent students will always have at least one parent contributor. If the student is completing the FAFSA form online,\nthey will be prompted to enter their parent9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and email\naddress) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The parent will be notified by email that they have been invited\nto contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The parent should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and\npassword to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s parent is married\nand filed their 2023 taxes jointly with their current spouse, only one parent contributor is required. If the student9s parent\nis either (1) married or remarried, or (2) unmarried and living together, and did not file their 2023 taxes jointly with their\ncurrent spouse or partner, the parent9s spouse or partner will be a required contributor on the student9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent complete the parent section.\nWho Counts as a Parent on the FAFSA?\nIn most cases, it9s clear who the parents are. A parent is a biological or adoptive parent, or a person that the state has\ndetermined to be a parent (for example, when a state allows another person9s name to be listed as a parent on a birth\ncertificate). A stepparent is considered a parent if married to a biological or adoptive parent and if the student counts\nthem in their family size. Biological and adoptive parents who are unmarried and living together select that as their\nmarital status, and both report their information on the FAFSA form."

See the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)=\nquestion for additional information.\nStudent Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28)\nThis information comes directly from the student spouse9s 2023 tax return. See the discussion of tax return data in the\n<Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX or be\nmanually entered by the student spouse. Unlike the student, the student9s spouse will not be asked to report taxable\ncollege grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits. If the student or spouse had an amount to report, the student should\nhave reported the joint total in the student section. The spouse will also not be asked about receipt of the earned income\ntax credit (EITC). Receipt of the EITC is used to determine if the student (or parent) is a single parent. If the student (or\nparent) is married, they are not a single parent, which makes it unnecessary to ask the spouse about the EITC.\nStudent Spouse Consent, Approval, and Signature (29)\nEvery student spouse contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The student spouse contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the\nIRS.\nApproval 3 The student spouse contributor must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may\nreceive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The student spouse contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their signature on the\nonline FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nMarried, independent students who did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete\nFAFSA ready for submission. The student will receive an email confirmation that the form was submitted. The spouse will\nsee an abbreviated confirmation that the form is complete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide\nan email address will receive email notification when their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA\nSubmission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission\nSummary.\nContributor: Parent\nThis section consists of 12 questions related to the parent of a dependent student.\nDependent students will always have at least one parent contributor. If the student is completing the FAFSA form online,\nthey will be prompted to enter their parent9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and email\naddress) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The parent will be notified by email that they have been invited\nto contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The parent should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and\npassword to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s parent is married\nand filed their 2023 taxes jointly with their current spouse, only one parent contributor is required. If the student9s parent\nis either (1) married or remarried, or (2) unmarried and living together, and did not file their 2023 taxes jointly with their\ncurrent spouse or partner, the parent9s spouse or partner will be a required contributor on the student9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent complete the parent section.\nWho Counts as a Parent on the FAFSA?\nIn most cases, it9s clear who the parents are. A parent is a biological or adoptive parent, or a person that the state has\ndetermined to be a parent (for example, when a state allows another person9s name to be listed as a parent on a birth\ncertificate). A stepparent is considered a parent if married to a biological or adoptive parent and if the student counts\nthem in their family size. Biological and adoptive parents who are unmarried and living together select that as their\nmarital status, and both report their information on the FAFSA form.",
        "However, there will be instances where manual entry of tax information will be necessary.\nThis information comes directly from the 2023 federal tax return of the parent9s (and parent9s spouse if married and filed\njointly with their current spouse).

If a dependent student9s parent\n(and their spouse or partner) received child support in the last complete calendar year, they should enter the total\namount received for all children in the family size in this question.\nParent Assets (40)\nAn asset is property that the family owns and has an exchange value. The FAFSA form collects current data (as of the day\nof signing the FAFSA form) about cash, savings, and checking accounts; investments; real estate; businesses; and\ninvestment farms.

The parent will see an abbreviated confirmation, letting them know that the form is\ncomplete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide an email address will receive email notification\nwhen their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who do not provide\nan email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nContributor: Parent Spouse or Partner\nThis section consists of five questions related to the spouse or partner of a parent of a dependent student. If the student9s\nparent is married, the spouse9s information is always required on the FAFSA form. If the student9s parent is unmarried and\nliving with a partner, the partner9s information is only required on the FAFSA form if the partner is also the student9s legal\nparent.\nThe parent spouse or partner is only a required contributor on the FAFSA form if the parent is either (1) married or\nremarried and did not file taxes jointly with their current spouse in 2023, or (2) unmarried and living with the student9s\nother legal parent. If the parent contributor is completing the FAFSA form online and the parent9s spouse is identified as a\nrequired contributor, the parent will be prompted to enter the parent spouse9s or partner9s identity information (name,\nSocial Security number, date of birth, and email address) to invite them to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The\nparent spouse or partner will be notified by email that they have been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form.\nThe spouse or partner should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and password to access the student9s\nFAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the parent9s spouse is not a required contributor, the parent will\nenter the same identifying information and email address, but the parent9s spouse will not be invited to contribute to the\nstudent9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent9s spouse or partner complete the",

Paper (PDF) FAFSA form filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nIn addition to certifying that the data on the FAFSA form is correct, the student is also signing a statement of educational\npurpose, which is required to receive Title IV funds. Among other things, the student agrees to spend Title IV funds only\non educational expenses and affirms that they are not in default on a federal loan and do not owe a grant overpayment.\nFAFSA Submission\nStudents who do not have any other required contributors now have a complete FAFSA form. Students who complete and\nsubmit their FAFSA form online will receive an email version of their confirmation page. When the applicant9s FAFSA form\nis processed, students who provided an email address will receive an email notification of processing with instructions to\naccess their FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their\nFAFSA Submission Summary. Applicants with additional required contributors will need these individuals to contribute to\ntheir FAFSA form, as described next.\nContributor: Student Spouse\nThis section consists of five questions related to the student9s spouse. The student9s spouse is a required contributor on\nthe FAFSA form if the student is married and did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse.\nIf a married student is completing the FAFSA form online and the student9s spouse is identified as a required contributor,\nthe student will be prompted to enter their spouse9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and\nemail address) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form.

If the\nstudent spouse does not have a Social Security number and is completing their section of the form online, the SSN field\nwill be blank, based on their StudentAid.gov account information.

        "Received (18)= question for a list of these federal benefits.\nParent Tax Filing Status (37)\nThis question asks if the parent filed (or will file) a 2023 IRS 1040 or 1040-NR. If the answer is <no=, the parent will be\nasked to select one of the following reasons for not filing:\n1. The parent filed or will file a tax return with Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory.\n2. The parent filed or will file a foreign tax return.\n3. The parent either earned income in a foreign country but did not and will not file a foreign tax return, or worked for\nan international organization and was not required to report income on any tax return.\n4. The parent, even though they earned income in the U.S., did not and will not file a U.S. tax return because their\nincome was below the filing threshold.\n5. The parent did not and will not file a U.S. tax return for reasons other than low income.\n6. The parent did not and will not file any tax return because they did not earn any income or they were not required to\nfile under the Internal Revenue Code.\nThe purpose of these questions is to determine if a parent was either (1) required to file a 2023 U.S. federal tax return and\ndid not or (2) has income from a foreign country that must be manually entered on the FAFSA form.\nA dependent student will be automatically eligible for a Maximum Pell Grant if their parent (and parent9s spouse or\npartner) is subject to the U.S. Tax Code but is not required to file a 2023 U.S. federal tax return. The student will be\nassigned an SAI of -1,500 and will not be required to provide any further financial information on the FAFSA form.\nFinally, married parents are asked if they filed their 2023 tax return with their current spouse. Individuals who were\nmarried and filed jointly with the IRS and are no longer married to the spouse on the applicable tax return, or who have\nmarried a different spouse, will be required to manually enter their income and tax information. See the <Joint Return\nFilers Who Are No Longer Married= section in Chapter 4 for additional information on separating tax return and income\ninformation.\nIndividuals who only file foreign tax returns will also be unable to use the FA-DDX since it does not link to foreign tax\nauthorities. They will instead need to manually input their income and tax data by converting foreign currency to U.S.\ndollars and entering the resulting amounts in the comparable fields from U.S. tax returns. See the <Student Tax Filing\nStatus (19)= question for additional information.\nIf the parent indicates they earned income in a foreign country but did not file a foreign tax return, or worked for an\ninternational organization, such as the United Nations, World Bank, or International Monetary Fund (option 3), they will\nneed to manually input their income and tax data, similar to individuals who file foreign tax returns. See <Non-tax filers,\nforeign countries, and international organizations= under <Student Tax Filing Status (19)= for additional guidance.\nIf a parent indicates they did not file a U.S. tax return for reasons other than low income (option 5), you should treat this\nas conflicting information and request documentation to resolve it, which may include requiring the individual to file a tax\nreturn and present sufficient documentation of filing to you.\nIf a parent indicates they did not file any tax return because they did not earn any income (option 6) and their state of\nlegal residence is a foreign country, you must determine if the parent has foreign untaxed income that, when included in\nthe SAI calculation, impacts a student9s Pell Grant eligibility. Comment code 303 on the student9s ISIR should prompt you\nto request additional documentation. If your inquiry into the parents9 financial situation shows that the student might be\neligible for less or no Pell grant funds, you may use PJ to account for the parents9 untaxed income and assets, similar to\nthe action you might take when there is a substantial foreign earned income exclusion on a U.S. tax return that can affect\na student9s Pell eligibility.\nParent 2023 Tax Return Information (38)\nFor U.S. tax filers, much of the information in Question 38 will be transferred directly from the IRS via the FA-DDX.",

Such students will be assigned an SAI of -1,500 and will not be required to\nprovide any further financial information on the FAFSA form.\nIndividuals who were married and filed jointly with the IRS and are no longer married to the spouse on the applicable tax\nreturn, and/or who have married a different spouse, will be required to manually enter their income and tax information.\nSee the <Joint Return Filers Who Are No Longer Married= section in Chapter 4 for additional information on separating tax\nreturn and income information.\nIndividuals who only file foreign tax returns will also be unable to use the FA-DDX since it does not link to foreign tax\nauthorities. They will instead need to manually input their income and tax data by converting foreign currency to U.S.\ndollars and entering the resulting amounts in the comparable fields from U.S. tax returns.\nPuerto Rico and Other U.S. Territory Residents\nSome individuals who reside in Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory may use an IRS Form 1040 or 1040-NR but file their\ntaxes with their local tax authority, not the IRS. These individuals should answer <No= to the question <Did or will the\nstudent file a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR?= and <Yes= to the subsequent question to indicate they filed a tax return\nwith Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory.\nAdditionally, some individuals who live and work in Puerto Rico may file two tax returns 3 one with the IRS and one with\nthe Puerto Rico tax authority. If they are filing electronically and FTI is available via the FA-DDX, only their tax information\nfiled with the IRS will be imported to the FAFSA form. They will not be able to manually enter the information from their\ntax return filed with Puerto Rico. If the FAA is aware of this dual filing scenario, the FAA should evaluate the applicant9s\ninformation and determine if the information from the Puerto Rico tax return should replace the information imported\nfrom the IRS. FAAs who determine that the information from the Puerto Rico tax return should be on the FAFSA should\nupdate the appropriate FAFSA fields and set the <Professional Judgment= indicator. While this is not a PJ, the changes to\nthe FAFSA application system require this work-around to override the IRS-transferred FTI with the manually updated FTI.\nFSA is working on system changes for future application cycles to allow for these updates without setting the <Professional\nJudgment= indicator. See Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-118 for additional information.\nNontax Filers, Foreign Countries, and International Organizations\nIn some countries the tax system does not operate as it does in the U.S., and people in those countries can earn a\nsubstantial amount of income and pay taxes without having to file a return. These individuals should answer <No= to the\nquestion <Did or will the student file a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR?= and <Yes= to the subsequent question to indicate\nthey earned income in a foreign country. While these individuals did not file taxes in the U.S., they are not eligible for an\nautomatic Maximum Pell Grant and must manually enter income and tax information.\nIn some instances, employees of certain international organizations, such as the United Nations, the International\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank, and others, might not be required to file a return. These individuals should answer <No=\nto the question <Did or will the student file a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR?= and <Yes= to the subsequent question to\nindicate they worked for an international organization. Like foreign non-filers described above, these individuals will be\nrequired to manually enter income and tax information, as they are not eligible to receive an automatic Maximum Pell\nGrant as a non-filer.\nIndividuals who earn income in a foreign country or as an employee of an international organization (e.g., World Bank,\nUnited Nations, and International Monetary Fund) and are not required to file a tax return should fill out the FAFSA form in\nthe following way using U.S. dollars:\nFor filing status, select <Single= if you9re single or <Married filing separately= if you9re married.\nFor AGI, include all wages, dividends, capital gains, business income, retirement distributions, and other income on\nwhich you may have paid taxes.\nFor income tax paid, include any income taxes you paid on income in your AGI.

You must also get a signed statement\ngiving the sources and amounts of the person9s income earned from work not found on W-2s. Students may sign on a\nnonfiling spouse9s behalf.\nFor residents of the Freely Associated States, a copy of the wage and tax statement from each employer (substitute for W-\n2s) and a signed statement identifying any other employment income for the year not identified on the wage and tax\nstatement is acceptable. Persons from a U.S. territory, commonwealth, or a foreign country who are not required to file a\ntax return can provide a signed statement, as well as any supporting documentation they might have (e.g., a form\ncomparable to a U.S. W-2), certifying their income.\nThe collection of documentation to verify income earned from work is used to determine if the applicant (and the\napplicable spouse or parent) was required to file a U.S. income tax return (or a return with a relevant tax authority) for the\n2023 tax year. If the individual should have filed but failed to do so, that is conflicting information that you must resolve.\nIf a W-2 is not Available\nIf an individual who is required to submit an IRS Form W-2 did not save a copy, they should request a replacement W-2\nfrom the employer who issued the original. A W-2 transcript from the IRS is also acceptable though it generally is not\navailable until the year after the W-2 information is filed with the IRS (e.g., 2025 for 2023 information filed in 2024).

        "This question asks if a 2023 IRS Form 1040 or 1040-NR was (or will be) completed. It also asks about income earned in a\nforeign country or if the student spouse filed a tax return in a U.S. territory. See the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)=\nquestion for additional information.\nStudent Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28)\nThis information comes directly from the student spouse9s 2023 tax return. See the discussion of tax return data in the\n<Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX or be\nmanually entered by the student spouse. Unlike the student, the student9s spouse will not be asked to report taxable\ncollege grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits. If the student or spouse had an amount to report, the student should\nhave reported the joint total in the student section. The spouse will also not be asked about receipt of the earned income\ntax credit (EITC). Receipt of the EITC is used to determine if the student (or parent) is a single parent. If the student (or\nparent) is married, they are not a single parent, which makes it unnecessary to ask the spouse about the EITC.\nStudent Spouse Consent, Approval, and Signature (29)\nEvery student spouse contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The student spouse contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the\nIRS.\nApproval 3 The student spouse contributor must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may\nreceive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The student spouse contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their signature on the\nonline FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nMarried, independent students who did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete\nFAFSA ready for submission. The student will receive an email confirmation that the form was submitted. The spouse will\nsee an abbreviated confirmation that the form is complete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide\nan email address will receive email notification when their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA\nSubmission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission\nSummary.\nContributor: Parent\nThis section consists of 12 questions related to the parent of a dependent student.\nDependent students will always have at least one parent contributor. If the student is completing the FAFSA form online,\nthey will be prompted to enter their parent9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and email\naddress) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The parent will be notified by email that they have been invited\nto contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The parent should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and\npassword to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s parent is married\nand filed their 2023 taxes jointly with their current spouse, only one parent contributor is required. If the student9s parent\nis either (1) married or remarried, or (2) unmarried and living together, and did not file their 2023 taxes jointly with their\ncurrent spouse or partner, the parent9s spouse or partner will be a required contributor on the student9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent complete the parent section.\nWho Counts as a Parent on the FAFSA?\nIn most cases, it9s clear who the parents are. A parent is a biological or adoptive parent, or a person that the state has\ndetermined to be a parent (for example, when a state allows another person9s name to be listed as a parent on a birth\ncertificate). A stepparent is considered a parent if married to a biological or adoptive parent and if the student counts\nthem in their family size. Biological and adoptive parents who are unmarried and living together select that as their\nmarital status, and both report their information on the FAFSA form."

These amounts are typically derived from IRS Form 1040, Schedule 1, line 21, which reports taxable scholarships and grants. \n\nIn summary, the student reports taxable grants and scholarships based on their tax return information, primarily using IRS Form 1040 Schedule 1 for accurate reporting and verification.",

This may be the same number as your AGI.\nFiscal Year Tax Returns\nFor a fiscal year (rather than calendar year) tax return, the individual should use information from the return that includes\nthe greater length of time in 2023. For example, an individual who files a fiscal year tax return that begins in September\nwould have two tax returns that overlap the 2023 calendar year 3 September 1, 2022, thru August 31, 2023, (FY23) and\nSeptember 1, 2023, thru August 31, 2024, (FY24). Since the FY23 tax return covers 8 months of the 2023 calendar year\nand the FY24 tax return covers 4 months of the 2023 calendar year, the individual should use the FY23 tax return that\nbegins on September 1, 2022, to complete the FAFSA form.\nNote: There are more days in the year between July 1 and December 31 (184 days) than between January 1 and June 30\n(181, or 182 in a leap year). Keep that in mind when determining the length of time attributed to a fiscal year tax return\nthat begins on July 1.\nStudent 2023 Tax Return Information (20)\nFor U.S. tax filers, much of the information in Question 20 will be transferred directly from the IRS via the FA-DDX.\nHowever, as noted previously, there will be instances where manual entry of tax information will be necessary.\nThis information comes directly from the 2023 federal tax return of the student9s (and the student9s spouse, if married\nand filed jointly with their current spouse). Non-tax filers will not be required to provide this information. The first list\nbelow is data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX, if available. The second list is data elements that the student\nmust enter manually.\nFA-DDX Transferred Data\nFiling status. Single, head of household, married filing jointly, married filing separately, or qualifying surviving\nspouse.\nIncome earned from work. From IRS Form 1040 (or IRS Form 1040-NR): line 1z + Schedule 1: lines 3 + 6.\nTax exempt interest income. From IRS Form 1040: line 2a.\nUntaxed portions of IRA distributions. The filer reports the full amount, including rollovers, of the untaxed\nportion, which is determined from IRS Form 1040: line 4a minus 4b. Rollover amounts are manually entered\nseparately and excluded in the SAI formula calculation.\nUntaxed portions of pensions. The filer reports the full amount, including rollovers, of the untaxed portion, which\nis determined from IRS Form 1040: line 5a minus 5b. Rollover amounts are manually entered separately and\nexcluded in the SAI formula calculation.\nAdjusted gross income. From IRS Form 1040 (or IRS Form 1040-NR): line 11. Amount can be negative.\nIncome tax paid. From IRS Form 1040: line 24\nIRA deductions and payments to self-employed SEP, SIMPLE, and qualified plans. From IRS Form 1040\nSchedule 1: total of lines 16 + 20.\nEducation credits. Includes American Opportunity (AOTC) and Lifetime Learning (LLC) credits. From IRS\nForm 1040: line 29 + IRS Form 1040 Schedule 3: line 3.\nSchedules filed. Did the tax filer file a Schedule A, B, D, E, F, or H?\nNet business profit or loss. From IRS Form 1040 Schedule C: line 31. Amount can be negative.\nManually Entered Data/Manually Provided Tax-Payer Data\nIRA rollover into another IRA or qualified plan. Typically indicated as \"ROLLOVER\" on IRS Form 1040-line 4.\nPension rollover into an IRA or other qualified plan. Typically indicated as \"ROLLOVER\" on IRS Form 1040-line\n5.\nEarned income credit (EIC) received. IRS Form 1040: line 27.\nTaxable grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits. This question is optional. The student should report only\nthe amount of grants and scholarships received (by the student and the student9s spouse, if applicable) that was\nreported as taxable income on the return. This includes grant and scholarship (not employment) portions of\nfellowships and assistantships, as well as taxable stipends and employer tuition reimbursements. Include AmeriCorps",
        "essentially a savings account, and its value as an asset is the current balance of the account.\nCoverdell education savings accounts, or ESAs, are another tax-advantaged savings vehicle for college education. They\nare treated the same as college savings plans: the current balance is an asset of the account owner.\nIf distributions from QTPs and ESAs do not exceed the qualified education expenses for which they are intended, they are\ntax-free, so they will not appear in the next year9s AGI. They should not be treated as other financial assistance (OFA). For\nmore information on these benefits, see the IRS9s Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education.\nRental properties are an asset. A unit within a family home that has its own entrance, kitchen, and bath (therefore a\nrented bedroom would not count) and that is rented to someone other than a family member counts as an asset. To\ncalculate its net value, multiply the net value of the entire structure by the fraction the rented space represents. Similarly,\nif a family owned a 10-unit apartment building and lived in one of the apartments, 9/10 or 90% of the net value of the\nbuilding would be an asset.\nTake-back mortgage value should be reported as an asset. In a take-back mortgage, the seller of a house finances a\nportion of its cost for the buyer, who repays this additional mortgage to the seller. The seller reports the interest part of\nany payments received from the buyer on Schedule B of IRS Form 1040. Therefore, if such interest is reported on a tax\nreturn, it likely indicates an asset that should be reported on the FAFSA form: the value of the take-back mortgage. There\nwould be no debt reported against this asset. For example, if an individual sold their house for $200,000 and financed a\ntake back mortgage of $40,000 to the buyer, the seller should report $40,000 as the net worth of the investment. The\nworth will decrease each year depending on how much of the principal the buyer paid back that year. This concept applies\nto other forms of seller financing of the sale of a home or other property.\nVirtual currency (or cryptocurrency) such as Bitcoin is considered an asset. The value (in U.S. dollars as of the day the\nFAFSA form is completed) of virtual currency must be reported on the FAFSA form. If the owner sells virtual currency and\nhas a capital gain from the sale, the taxable portion will be in the AGI for the year it is reported on the tax return, and the\nAGI will then be included on the associated FAFSA form. For more information on how the IRS treats virtual currencies,\nplease see the IRS virtual currency webpage.\nUniform Gifts and Uniform Transfers to Minors Acts (UGMA and UTMA) allow the establishment of an account for\ngifts of cash and financial assets for a minor without the expense of creating a trust. Because the minor is the owner of\nthe account, it counts as the minor9s asset on the FAFSA form, not the asset of the custodian, who is often the parent.\nTrust funds are considered an asset of the named beneficiary of the trust, even if the beneficiary9s access to the trust is\nrestricted. If the settlor of a trust has voluntarily placed restrictions on its use, then the beneficiary should report its\npresent value as an asset, as discussed below. If a trust has been restricted by court order, however, the beneficiary\nshould not report it. An example of such a restricted trust is one set up by court order to pay for future surgery for the\nvictim of a car accident.\nHow the trust must be reported depends on whether the beneficiary receives or will receive the interest income, the trust\nprincipal, or both. In the case of a divorce or separation where the trust is owned jointly and ownership is not being\ncontested, the property and the debt are equally divided between the owners for reporting purposes unless the terms of\nthe trust specify some other method of division.\nIf a beneficiary receives interest only from the trust, any interest received in the base year must be reported as income.\nIf the interest accumulates and is not paid out, the recipient must report an asset value for the interest they will receive.\nThe trust officer can usually calculate the value of the interest the person will receive while the trust exists. This value\nrepresents the amount a third person would be willing to pay for the interest income.\nThe person who will receive principal only from the trust must report the present value of his or her right to that\nprincipal as an asset. For example, if a $10,000 principal reverts to a student9s parent when the trust ends in ten years\nand the student is receiving the interest, the student would report the interest received as income and the present value\nof the student9s parent9s rights to the principal is reported as an asset of the parent (if the student is required to report\nparental data) on the student9s FAFSA form. The present value of the principal can be calculated by the trust officer; it9s\nthe amount that a third person would pay for the right to receive the principal ten years from now4basically, the amount\nthat one would have to deposit now to receive $10,000 in ten years.\nIf a beneficiary receives both interest and principal from the trust, the beneficiary should report the present value of",

Using the IRS Tax Table or Tax Rate Schedule for the appropriate year, calculate\nthe amount of tax that would have been paid if a separate return had been filed. Use the deductions the individual\ncould have claimed if the individual had filed a separate return. (If itemized deductions were taken, count only the\nportion of those deductions that could have been claimed on a separate tax return.)\nProportional distribution. Determine what percentage of the joint AGI was attributable to the individual, and then\nassess the joint taxes paid by that same percentage.\nIndividuals With Filing Extensions\nThe IRS may grant a filing extension (beyond the automatic six-month extension) to an individual required to file a 2023\nIRS income tax return. For an individual who receives such a filing extension, the student must submit the following:\nA signed statement listing the sources of any 2023 income and the amount of income from each source;\nA copy of the IRS's approval of an extension beyond the automatic six-month extension for tax year 2023;)\nA copy of IRS Form W-2 for each source of 2023 employment income received or an equivalent document; and\nIf self-employed, the signed statement must indicate the amount of estimated AGI and U.S. income tax paid for tax\nyear 2023.\nYou may require individuals with a filing extension to provide final income information to you after the return has been\nfiled. If you do that, you must reverify the income information. If the student does not provide final income information,\nsee the guidance described under the <Deadlines and Failure to Submit Documentation= section later in this chapter on\nfailing to complete verification. See DOC-Q16 on the Program Integrity Questions and Answers 3 Verification.\nFor a person called up for active duty or qualifying National Guard duty during a war, another military operation, or a\nnational emergency, a school must accept a statement from the person certifying that they have not filed an income tax\nreturn or a request for a filing extension because of that service.\nFilers of Amended Returns\nSeparating a Joint Return Example\nAVG, Chapter 4, Example 2: A student9s application is selected for verification. The student filed joint return\nwith their spouse in 2023 but have now divorced. The AGI on the student9s FAFSA matches the AGI of $56,500 on\nthe 2023 tax return, which means it9s wrong because it includes the student9s former spouse's income.\nThe student9s W-2 shows that their income for 2023 was $25,900, and the tax return shows $400 in interest.\nBecause it was interest on a joint savings account, the aid administrator adds $200 of it to the student9s income\nand submits $26,100 as the corrected income.\nThe aid administrator then determines that if the student had filed their tax return as single in 2023, their\nstandard deduction would have been $13,850 (instead of $27,700 for married filers). The student9s income of\n$26,100 minus $13,850 for the standard deduction results in $12,250 in taxable income.\nThe aid administrator uses the 2023 tax table to determine how much tax the student would have paid on this\namount, considering any applicable credits reported on the original return. With a taxable income of $12,250, the\ntax amount from the tax schedule is $1,253.\nTo use the proportional distribution method instead, the aid administrator figures out what percentage of the joint\nAGI student9s income represents. The percentage is 46% (26,100 ÷ 56,500 is .4619). The aid administrator then\nmultiplies the income tax paid as reported on the tax return ($3,019 for this example) by this percentage. The\nstudent9s income tax by using this method is $1,394 (.46 x $3,019).",
        "the 2025-26 award year. Students may update the answer to this question if their plans change or they progress to a\nhigher grade level during the award year.\nA student9s grade level is not based on the number of years the student has attended college but on work completed\ntoward the degree or certificate. For instance, a full-time student might attain second-year grade level after one year of\nstudy, while a half-time student would take two years to reach that level.\nThe student should also indicate whether they will have a first bachelor9s degree before beginning the 2025-26 year\nbecause eligibility for Pell and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity grants (FSEOG) is almost exclusively\nrestricted to students who have not received a bachelor9s degree or completed the requirements for one. See <General\nEligibility Requirements for Federal Pell Grants= in Volume 7, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook regarding degrees from\nunaccredited and foreign schools, which can count as bachelor9s degrees for Pell and FSEOG eligibility.\nIf the student indicates they have a first bachelor9s degree, they should also indicate if they will be pursuing an initial\nteaching certification at the elementary or secondary level. If a student answers <yes= to this question, you must evaluate\nand determine if the student is enrolled in a postbaccalaureate program for which a student may receive a Pell Grant. See\nVolume 7, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook regarding eligible postbaccalaureate programs.\nA student who is a graduate or professional student is independent for purposes of Title IV aid and not eligible for Pell\ngrants or other forms of undergraduate aid. If a Pell-eligible student incorrectly indicates they are working on a master9s,\ndoctorate, or graduate certificate program, they must submit a correction before they can receive a Pell grant. If a student\ncompletes an undergraduate program during the year and begins graduate school, the student can update the answer to\nthis question and the FPS will reprocess the student9s application.\nSee Volume 1, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook for definitions of undergraduate and graduate students.\nStudent Personal (5), Homelessness (6), or Unusual (7) Circumstances\nThe law governing the Title IV programs is based on the premise that the family is the first source of the student9s\nsupport, and the law provides several criteria that decide if the student is considered independent of their parents for aid\neligibility. Note that a student reaching the age of 18 or 21 or living apart from their parents does not on its own affect\ntheir dependency status.\nQuestions 5 and 6, along with information from other FAFSA questions, are used to determine if a student meets eligibility\ncriteria to be considered independent and not required to submit information about their parents. If a student is\nconsidered a dependent of their parents, the parents' must include their financial information on the FAFSA form. The FPS\nwill calculate a parent contribution and add it to the student9s contribution to derive an SAI.\nFor the 2025-26 year, a student who meets one or more of the following criteria is independent:\nFrom Question 1:\nUndergraduate student definition\n34 CFR 668.2(b) <Undergraduate student=\nGraduate student definition\n34 CFR 668.2(b) <Graduate or professional student="

      "response": "The FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) streamlines the FAFSA application process by enabling the direct transfer of certain federal tax information (FTI) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the Department of Education's Federal Student Aid (FSA). This process reduces the need for applicants and their contributors, such as parents or spouses, to manually report and verify income and tax data. \n\nSpecifically, the FA-DDX utilizes a secure, near-real-time connection established through an application programming interface (API) between the IRS and FSA to facilitate the automatic, electronic retrieval of relevant tax data. This automation speeds up the verification process, enhances accuracy, and ensures that the FTI used in determining financial aid eligibility is considered verified, thereby eliminating the need for additional documentation.\n\nThe role of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) in this process is foundational. The FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the IRC, mandating the IRS to disclose certain tax return information to the Department of Education via the FA-DDX. This legal change ensures authorized, lawful access to the necessary tax data, with the individual’s consent and approval, to improve the efficiency and reliability of FAFSA data collection and verification. \n\nIn summary, the FA-DDX leverages the authority granted by the IRC to facilitate a secure, direct exchange of tax data, thereby simplifying and expediting the FAFSA application process while maintaining compliance with federal laws governing information disclosure.",

        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3.\nThe easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported. However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form.\nFUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form.\nConsent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper).\nTo provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department.\nFAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",
        "Application and Verification Guide\nIntroduction\nThis guide is intended for college financial aid administrators and counselors who help students with the financial aid\nprocess4completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, verifying information, and making\ncorrections and other changes to the information reported on the FAFSA form.\nThroughout the Federal Student Aid Handbook, we use <college,= <school,= and <institution= interchangeably unless a\nmore specific use is given. Similarly, <student,= <applicant,= and <aid recipient= are synonyms. <Parents= in this volume\nrefers to the legal parents of dependent students, and <you= refers to the primary audience of the Handbook: financial aid\nadministrators at colleges. <We= indicates the U.S. Department of Education (the Department, ED), and <federal student\naid= and <Title IV aid= are synonymous terms for the financial aid offered by the Department.\nWe appreciate any comments that you have on the Application and Verification Guide (AVG), as well as all the volumes of\nthe FSA Handbook. We revise the text based on questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please\nreach out to us about how to improve the FSA Handbook through the <Contact Customer Support= feature in our Partner\nConnect Help Center clicking on <FSA Handbook= under the Topic section.\nFAFSA Simplification Act\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a\nsignificant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need\nanalysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the\nFAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for\nEducation (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process.\nChanges From the FUTURE Act\nThe Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data\nexchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate\ncompleting the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data\nRetrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX\neliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information\nreported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered\nverified for Title IV purposes.\nUnlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s\nspouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via\nthe FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid.\nOther Changes\nThroughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references\nhave been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year.\nWhere appropriate, links and publications associated with FSA9s Partner Connect and Knowledge Center have been\nproperly updated. We also removed references to COVID-19 guidance and waivers.\nSome sections were moved to better align topics and assist with narrative flow. Use the search feature to find sections\nthat may have been relocated. The following describes changes made in each chapter.\nChapter 1: The Application Process\nWe removed the <Returning FAFSA Filers= section as FAFSA renewal functionality has been deferred for future cycles.",
        "Verification Following Disasters\nThe Dear Colleague Letter GEN-17-08 gives general guidance for awarding aid in federally declared disasters. It states\nthat the Secretary will not enforce the verification requirements during the award year for applicants whose records were\nlost or destroyed because of a disaster if the school has tried to preserve and reconstruct any records. The school must\ndocument when it does not perform verification for this reason and use status code <S= when reporting the disbursement\nof Pell Grants to affected students. Also, the requirement for dependent students to submit a statement signed by a\nparent regarding family size is waived if the parents cannot provide the signature due to the disaster. The school must\nnote why no parent was able to provide the statement.\nSchools that experience a local disaster (rather than a federally declared one) that affects Title IV administration should\nconsult their regional school participation division.\nAcceptable Documentation\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act requires that, wherever possible, the Department use data received directly from the IRS to\ncalculate a student9s SAI and Pell Grant award. The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education\nAct (FUTURE Act) requires the Department of Education to access tax information held by the IRS pertaining to FAFSA\napplicants4and, where applicable, their parents and spouses4through a secure method: the FUTURE Act Direct Data\nExchange (FA-DDX). The FUTURE Act amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to mandate the disclosure of FTI directly\nfrom the IRS to the Department with an individual9s consent and approval. The FUTURE Act also made providing consent\nand approval for the exchange of FTI a requirement for receiving federal student aid.\nApplicants and contributors will be required to provide consent and approval to retrieve FTI directly from the IRS. When\nFTI is received from the IRS via the FA-DDX, the FTI received is considered verified and no additional documentation is\nnecessary. As a result, the FA-DDX is the fastest, easiest, and most secure method of meeting income and tax verification\nrequirements. The September 4, 2024 Federal Register Notice gives the documentation required for verifying 2025-26\napplication data, which depends on the item verified, as explained in this section.\nIf you use a verification document, be sure that it is signed, that all required sections are completed, and that any\nrelevant tax or alternative documents are attached. Copies of original documents are acceptable. An original signature on\nan original document, an original signature on a copy of a document, and a copy of a document with an original signature\non it are all valid signatures, unless specifically noted in this chapter. If a copy of the tax return is used, the filer (or at\nleast one of the filers of a joint return) must sign it or the tax preparer must provide their name and SSN, EIN, or PTIN.\nSuggested Verification Text\nThe Department has developed suggested text that you may use to create a verification document and to verify non-tax\nitems, such as family size. To review the suggested text for 2025-26, please see Dear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10. The\nsuggested text fulfills verification requirements, but schools do not have to use it, except as noted below. Instead, they\nmay develop and use their own (or someone else9s) text, forms, documents, statements, and certifications that are\nspecific to the items required to be verified for a particular student or group of students at the school. However, schools\nthey tried to locate their estranged spouse. The school determines that the student doesn9t need to verify their\nspouse9s tax and income information. However, the student must still verify their own information. The school\nmay also choose to use professional judgment to remove the spouse9s information from the student9s FAFSA form.\nVerification Exclusions\n34 CFR 668.54(b)",
        "electronically due to limitations on access to computers and the internet. These applicants can complete a paper (PDF)\nFAFSA form designated specifically for incarcerated applicants, available on the Prison Education Programs resource page\nof the FSA Knowledge Center.\nThe mailing address for the Incarcerated Applicant FAFSA form is printed on the first page of the form under <Mail Your\nFAFSA® Form=. The address changes annually and differs from the general FAFSA form mailing address, so use the\naddress printed on the associated year9s Incarcerated Applicant FAFSA form. You must mail all fillable pages of the form\n(pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to the applicant. Extra postage will be\nrequired due to the size and/or weight of the mailing.\nFAFSA Partner Portal\nThe FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP) replaced FAA Access to CPS Online beginning with the 2024-25 award year. FSA\ndecommissioned the FAA Access site after the 2023324 application cycle closed.\nThe FAFSA Partner Portal removed the ability for a financial aid administrator (FAA) to initiate a new application on behalf\nof a student. This is due to the requirement in the FUTURE Act that all FAFSA form contributors (including students,\nspouses, and parents) must provide their consent to disclose information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\napproval to retrieve and use certain Federal Tax Information (FTI). FAAs cannot provide consent and approval on behalf of\nany other person. Therefore, you will not be able to use the FPP to start and submit a new FAFSA form on an applicant9s\nbehalf. However, you can make certain corrections or updates.\nTranslation Assistance\nThe FAFSA form is available in English and Spanish. If you need assistance completing the form in English or Spanish\ncontact the FSAIC at 1-800-433-3243. Translation assistance in additional languages is available by calling 1-833-610-\n2590 and pressing <7= to request a specific language.\nAccount Username and Password (FSA ID)\nThe account username and password, also known as the FSA ID, is used to access a person9s StudentAid.gov account. It\nserves as an electronic signature and a digital identifier to allow access to various ED systems and services for students,\nspouses of students, parents, or spouses/partners of parents. Therefore, each individual must create their own account\nand should not share their login credentials with anyone, including FAAs. Users can create an account online at\nStudentAid.gov quickly and securely. See Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-123 for additional information on\ncreating a StudentAid.gov account for individuals without a Social Security number.\nEach person who provides data in the online FAFSA form must have an account username and password to access the\nform. In the past, a Social Security number (SSN) was required to create a StudentAid.gov account. Starting with the\n2024325 award year, all individuals4even those without an SSN4can create a StudentAid.gov account. Persons with an\nSSN will still have their information verified by the Social Security Administration (SSA), while those without an SSN will\nuse the TransUnion® knowledge-based identity verification process described below.\nThe account username and password are created in real-time so that the student or other contributor can use it\nimmediately to enter the FAFSA form. Pending StudentAid.gov accounts with an SSN will be sent to the SSA to be\nmatched. Only those accounts with a successful match (<SSA Match Status= value of 4 on the Institutional Student\nNote: There will be two active portals that coincide with the two open FAFSA application cycles.
