      "response": "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, through the FAFSA Simplification Act, introduced significant changes to the FAFSA process. The key changes include:\n\n1. **Implementation of the FA-DDX:** The Act authorized a direct data exchange (FA-DDX) with the IRS, replacing the previous IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT). This allows most applicants to have their federal tax information automatically transferred and considered verified, reducing the need for self-reporting income information.\n\n2. **Requirements for Consent and Approval:** Both students and contributors (such as parents and spouses) must provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain and use their federal tax information via the FA-DDX. This ensures privacy and compliance with legal standards.\n\n3. **Changes to Application Processes:** The FAFSA Partner Portal was updated to remove the ability for financial aid administrators to initiate applications on behalf of students, due to the need for contributor consent for data access. Additionally, online filing is emphasized as the preferred method, contributing to faster processing and fewer errors.\n\n4. **Updated Verification Procedures:** Enhanced guidance and procedural modifications were made, including the unavailability of certain identity verification functionalities and modified reporting timeframes.\n\nIn summary, the Act streamlined the FAFSA application process by enabling automatic data transfer from the IRS with proper consent, clarified consent procedures, and made adjustments to the application and verification processes to improve efficiency and privacy.",

        "Application and Verification Guide\nIntroduction\nThis guide is intended for college financial aid administrators and counselors who help students with the financial aid\nprocess4completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, verifying information, and making\ncorrections and other changes to the information reported on the FAFSA form. Throughout the Federal Student Aid Handbook, we use <college,= <school,= and <institution= interchangeably unless a\nmore specific use is given. Similarly, <student,= <applicant,= and <aid recipient= are synonyms. <Parents= in this volume\nrefers to the legal parents of dependent students, and <you= refers to the primary audience of the Handbook: financial aid\nadministrators at colleges. <We= indicates the U.S. Department of Education (the Department, ED), and <federal student\naid= and <Title IV aid= are synonymous terms for the financial aid offered by the Department. We appreciate any comments that you have on the Application and Verification Guide (AVG), as well as all the volumes of\nthe FSA Handbook. We revise the text based on questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please\nreach out to us about how to improve the FSA Handbook through the <Contact Customer Support= feature in our Partner\nConnect Help Center clicking on <FSA Handbook= under the Topic section. FAFSA Simplification Act\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a\nsignificant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need\nanalysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the\nFAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for\nEducation (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process. Changes From the FUTURE Act\nThe Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data\nexchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate\ncompleting the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data\nRetrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX\neliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information\nreported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered\nverified for Title IV purposes. Unlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s\nspouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via\nthe FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid. Other Changes\nThroughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references\nhave been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year. Where appropriate, links and publications associated with FSA9s Partner Connect and Knowledge Center have been\nproperly updated. We also removed references to COVID-19 guidance and waivers. Some sections were moved to better align topics and assist with narrative flow.",
        "Chapter 2: Filling Out the FAFSA\nWe added a section on signatures which describes the appropriate use of the signature page from the FAFSA Partner\nPortal (FPP). We expanded the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)= section to include subsections on (1) nontax filers, foreign\ncountries, and international organizations and (2) fiscal year tax returns. We updated the tax line number used for education credits to IRS Form 1040: line 29 + IRS Form 1040 Schedule 3:\nline 3. We moved the section on foreign earned income exclusion to Chapter 5. We expanded <Parent Tax Filing Status (37)= section to explain the six answer options on the FAFSA form and when\neach answer should be selected. This section also explains when an answer to this question might be conflicting\ninformation that requires resolution (comment code 303). Chapter 3: Student Aid Index (SAI) and Pell Grant Eligibility\nEdits to this chapter include general changes and updated links, but no significant changes or reorganization. Chapter 4: Verification, Updates, and Corrections\nWe added a note regarding the unavailability of the Verification of Identity functionality in the FPP and the flexibility\nthe Department provided around reporting timeframes.",
        "However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form. FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form. Consent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper). To provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department. FAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",

        "This form is the Free\nApplication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form. To be considered for federal student aid, a student must complete a FAFSA form. It collects financial and other information\nused to calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI; formerly Expected Family Contribution or EFC) and to determine a student9s\neligibility through computer matches with other agencies. The FAFSA form is the only application students must complete to apply for Title IV aid. A school cannot require extra\ninformation from students to package Title IV aid, except for verification, resolution of conflicting information, or\nprofessional judgment determinations. However, a school may require additional information for other purposes, such as\npackaging private or institutional aid. If the school collects additional information that affects Title IV eligibility, it must\ntake the information into account when awarding Title IV aid. Types of FAFSA Applications\nMore than 99% of FAFSA forms are filed electronically. However, there are other options for individuals unwilling or unable\nto file electronically. FAFSA Online\nImplementation of the FAFSA Simplification Act and the FUTURE Act required a complete overhaul of the FAFSA form,\nbeginning with the 2024-25 award year. Submitted FAFSA forms are sent directly to the FAFSA Processing System (FPS). Help is available for students online or by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-4-FED-AID\n(1-800-433-3243). There are many advantages to filing electronically, including:\nFaster processing;\nAvailability of online help;\nSkip logic, which allows applicants to skip over questions that don9t pertain to them; and\nFewer errors and rejected applications because internal and end-of-entry data edits ensure that required fields are\ncompleted and conflicts are resolved prior to submission. Paper (PDF) FAFSA Form\nThe paper (PDF) FAFSA form is available on StudentAid.gov. In future cycles, students will also be able to call the Federal\nStudent Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-433-3243 to request a single copy. The form can be printed and completed by hand, or by typing the data on the PDF before printing and mailing it. The\nmailing address is printed on the first page of the FAFSA form under <Mail Your FAFSA® Form=. The address changes\nannually, so use the address printed on the associated year9s FAFSA form. You must mail all fillable pages of the form (pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to\nthe applicant.",
        "Extra postage will be\nrequired due to the size and/or weight of the mailing. FAFSA Partner Portal\nThe FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP) replaced FAA Access to CPS Online beginning with the 2024-25 award year. FSA\ndecommissioned the FAA Access site after the 2023324 application cycle closed. The FAFSA Partner Portal removed the ability for a financial aid administrator (FAA) to initiate a new application on behalf\nof a student. This is due to the requirement in the FUTURE Act that all FAFSA form contributors (including students,\nspouses, and parents) must provide their consent to disclose information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\napproval to retrieve and use certain Federal Tax Information (FTI). FAAs cannot provide consent and approval on behalf of\nany other person. Therefore, you will not be able to use the FPP to start and submit a new FAFSA form on an applicant9s\nbehalf.",
        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3. The easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported.",
        "Deadlines\nThe application processing cycle typically lasts 21 months, with the FAFSA form opening on October 1 in the year prior to\nthe start of the award year. For the 2025-26 application cycle, the online FAFSA opened for beta testing to a limited\npopulation of applicants on October 1, with the form expected to be available to all applicants by December 1, 2024. Applications will be accepted through June 30, 2026. The FPS must receive a student9s online FAFSA information by June 30, 2026. A paper FAFSA form must be legible, and it\nmust be mailed to the Federal Student Aid Programs address listed on the FAFSA form in time for the processor to receive\nit by June 30, 2026. There are no exceptions to these deadlines.",
        "However, you can make certain corrections or updates. Translation Assistance\nThe FAFSA form is available in English and Spanish. If you need assistance completing the form in English or Spanish\ncontact the FSAIC at 1-800-433-3243. Translation assistance in additional languages is available by calling 1-833-610-\n2590 and pressing <7= to request a specific language. Account Username and Password (FSA ID)\nThe account username and password, also known as the FSA ID, is used to access a person9s StudentAid.gov account. It\nserves as an electronic signature and a digital identifier to allow access to various ED systems and services for students,\nspouses of students, parents, or spouses/partners of parents. Therefore, each individual must create their own account\nand should not share their login credentials with anyone, including FAAs. Users can create an account online at\nStudentAid.gov quickly and securely. See Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-123 for additional information on\ncreating a StudentAid.gov account for individuals without a Social Security number. Each person who provides data in the online FAFSA form must have an account username and password to access the\nform. In the past, a Social Security number (SSN) was required to create a StudentAid.gov account. Starting with the\n2024325 award year, all individuals4even those without an SSN4can create a StudentAid.gov account. Persons with an\nSSN will still have their information verified by the Social Security Administration (SSA), while those without an SSN will\nuse the TransUnion® knowledge-based identity verification process described below. The account username and password are created in real-time so that the student or other contributor can use it\nimmediately to enter the FAFSA form. Pending StudentAid.gov accounts with an SSN will be sent to the SSA to be\nmatched. Only those accounts with a successful match (<SSA Match Status= value of 4 on the Institutional Student\nNote: There will be two active portals that coincide with the two open FAFSA application cycles.

This tool helps\ndetermine which parent(s) should participate in a student9s FAFSA form. Resources for schools\n2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide 3 This guide consolidates all FAFSA-related processing information and\nguidance into a multi-volume resource. It includes the following volumes and replaces previous stand-alone\nguides:\nVolume 1 3 Summary of Changes (PDF)\nVolume 2 3 FPS Schedule and Getting Help (PDF)\nVolume 3 3 Electronic Data Exchange and FAFSA Processing (PDF)",
        "You will receive an ISIR for the student only if the applicant includes your school on their FAFSA form. If your school is not\nlisted, you can request an ISIR for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal by adding your federal school code if you\nhave the applicant9s Data Release Number (DRN), which authorizes your access to the student9s application information. The DRN appears on the FAFSA Submission Summary, on the FAFSA confirmation page, and in the FAFSA confirmation\nemail. You are required to receive ISIRs and to accept FAFSA Submission Summaries from students, but you cannot require\nstudents to submit FAFSA Submission Summaries to receive aid. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student, your federal\nschool code must be added to their record so that an ISIR is sent to you. We recommend making corrections electronically\nvia the online FAFSA (the student) or the FAFSA Partner Portal (the school); however, students can also use a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary to make corrections. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student who provided a FAFSA Submission\nSummary, you must use the FAFSA Submission Summary to package and disburse the student aid. Again, you must also\nensure that your school code is added to the student9s FPS record (see the <How to Submit Corrections and Updates=\nsection in Chapter 4). The FAFSA Submission Summaries and ISIRs include comment codes and text explaining any questionable results from\nFAFSA processing. Some comment codes also have an associated C Flag, which you must resolve before paying the\nstudent aid. If a student9s FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR contains a comment code that requires resolution, the\nunderlying issue must be resolved before any Title IV funds may be disbursed to the student. For instance, if an applicant\nhas defaulted on a federal student loan, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will note this in several places,\nincluding comments to the applicant and the NSLDS financial aid history page. In addition, if a school disburses Title IV\nfunds to a student with a comment code that requires resolution and the student withdraws before the school has\nresolved the underlying issue, any funds disbursed must be returned to ED since the funds were provided to an otherwise\nineligible student. For other problems, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will show that the FAFSA form has been rejected and no SAI\nhas been calculated. The FAFSA Submission Summary will tell the applicant how to resolve the reject by correcting errors\nor providing consent and approval, signatures, or more information. A complete list of comments, C Flags, reject codes,\nand required resolutions are available in Volume 7 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide. A valid output document (ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary) is one on which all the information reported on a student9s\nFAFSA form is accurate and complete as of the date the application is signed. Valid Output Document\n34 CFR 668.2(b)",
        "The FPS also checks the application for possible inconsistencies and mistakes. For instance, if a dependent student\nreported the parents9 marital status as married but reported the family size as <2,= the edit checks would catch the\ninconsistency. Even when data is inconsistent, the FPS may be able to calculate an SAI based on assumptions. Students\nwho submit applications online will be able to correct or confirm FPS edits before submitting the application. Output Documents\nAfter processing is complete, the FPS produces output documents 3 the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) and\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary 3 that show the information the student originally provided, the SAI, results of the\neligibility matches, information about aid history, and information about any inconsistencies identified through the FPS\nedits. If the FPS was unable to calculate an SAI, the output record will not show one. The ISIR is made available\nelectronically to the schools the student listed on the FAFSA form (or added later) and their state agency. The FAFSA\nSubmission Summary is made available to the student online or a paper FAFSA Submission Summary is mailed to the\nstudent if the student is unable to access it online.",
        "This form is the Free\nApplication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form. To be considered for federal student aid, a student must complete a FAFSA form. It collects financial and other information\nused to calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI; formerly Expected Family Contribution or EFC) and to determine a student9s\neligibility through computer matches with other agencies. The FAFSA form is the only application students must complete to apply for Title IV aid. A school cannot require extra\ninformation from students to package Title IV aid, except for verification, resolution of conflicting information, or\nprofessional judgment determinations. However, a school may require additional information for other purposes, such as\npackaging private or institutional aid. If the school collects additional information that affects Title IV eligibility, it must\ntake the information into account when awarding Title IV aid. Types of FAFSA Applications\nMore than 99% of FAFSA forms are filed electronically. However, there are other options for individuals unwilling or unable\nto file electronically. FAFSA Online\nImplementation of the FAFSA Simplification Act and the FUTURE Act required a complete overhaul of the FAFSA form,\nbeginning with the 2024-25 award year. Submitted FAFSA forms are sent directly to the FAFSA Processing System (FPS). Help is available for students online or by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-4-FED-AID\n(1-800-433-3243). There are many advantages to filing electronically, including:\nFaster processing;\nAvailability of online help;\nSkip logic, which allows applicants to skip over questions that don9t pertain to them; and\nFewer errors and rejected applications because internal and end-of-entry data edits ensure that required fields are\ncompleted and conflicts are resolved prior to submission. Paper (PDF) FAFSA Form\nThe paper (PDF) FAFSA form is available on StudentAid.gov. In future cycles, students will also be able to call the Federal\nStudent Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-433-3243 to request a single copy. The form can be printed and completed by hand, or by typing the data on the PDF before printing and mailing it. The\nmailing address is printed on the first page of the FAFSA form under <Mail Your FAFSA® Form=. The address changes\nannually, so use the address printed on the associated year9s FAFSA form. You must mail all fillable pages of the form (pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to\nthe applicant.",
        "The type of output document depends on the type of record that the\napplicant submitted. Neither the online nor the paper FAFSA Submission Summary will contain FTI. See Volume 6 of the\n2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide for additional information.",
        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3. The easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported.",
        "The FAFSA form is organized by contributor. Each contributor will complete their own section of the form\nwhich contains specific questions and instructions pertaining to that contributor. The guidance in this chapter\nsupplements those instructions and explains why some of the questions are needed on the FAFSA form. The following sections discuss the questions found within each contributor section on the FAFSA form. The parents\nmentioned are the legal parents of dependent students. The numbers in parentheses are for the items as they appear on\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary, ISIR, paper (PDF) FAFSA, and FAFSA Partner Portal. The FAFSA form is considered a\n<snapshot= of the family9s information as of the date the application is signed and it can be updated only in certain\ncircumstances and only for certain items. See Chapter 4 for more information about updating a FAFSA form. Contributor: Student\nThis section consists of 24 questions related to the student. Student Identity Information (1)\nThis question requests the name, date of birth, and Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification\nNumber (ITIN) of the student contributor. The name, with other identifying information, is used for several data matches.",
        "See Electronic Announcement APP-24-02 for additional information. Processing the FAFSA\nApplications that are signed and submitted online go directly to the FPS. The paper FAFSA forms go to the FAFSA\nprocessor for data entry and then to the FPS. The FPS uses application data to calculate the SAI and to match the\nstudent9s information against several databases: NSLDS, the SSA, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as the\nDepartment of Homeland Security9s database of noncitizens. Individuals Without a Social Security Number\nElectronic Announcement GENERAL-23-123\nElectronic Announcement GENERAL-24-52\nElectronic Announcement GENERAL-24-95\nElectronic Announcement GENERAL-24-140",
        "This is to enhance security, privacy, and to\nreduce the risk of the misuse of sensitive data. However, you (the financial aid administrator) will be able to see the\ntransferred data on the ISIR. Schools and other partners that receive ISIRs must protect federal student aid information\nprovided to them by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the application, award, and administration of the\nfederal student aid programs as permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA, as amended. In keeping with the\nexpectation that you protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, you must not disclose FTI\nfrom the FAFSA form unless the disclosure and use is permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA 1098h. For additional\ninformation and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34. Signatures\nEach student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS\nand (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per\napplication cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a\nprocessed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is\naccurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction\nto contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating\nthat the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their\nFAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect\nthe necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature\nrequirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval.",
        "However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form. FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form. Consent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper). To provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department. FAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor."

        "You will receive an ISIR for the student only if the applicant includes your school on their FAFSA form. If your school is not\nlisted, you can request an ISIR for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal by adding your federal school code if you\nhave the applicant9s Data Release Number (DRN), which authorizes your access to the student9s application information. The DRN appears on the FAFSA Submission Summary, on the FAFSA confirmation page, and in the FAFSA confirmation\nemail. You are required to receive ISIRs and to accept FAFSA Submission Summaries from students, but you cannot require\nstudents to submit FAFSA Submission Summaries to receive aid. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student, your federal\nschool code must be added to their record so that an ISIR is sent to you. We recommend making corrections electronically\nvia the online FAFSA (the student) or the FAFSA Partner Portal (the school); however, students can also use a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary to make corrections. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student who provided a FAFSA Submission\nSummary, you must use the FAFSA Submission Summary to package and disburse the student aid. Again, you must also\nensure that your school code is added to the student9s FPS record (see the <How to Submit Corrections and Updates=\nsection in Chapter 4). The FAFSA Submission Summaries and ISIRs include comment codes and text explaining any questionable results from\nFAFSA processing. Some comment codes also have an associated C Flag, which you must resolve before paying the\nstudent aid. If a student9s FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR contains a comment code that requires resolution, the\nunderlying issue must be resolved before any Title IV funds may be disbursed to the student. For instance, if an applicant\nhas defaulted on a federal student loan, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will note this in several places,\nincluding comments to the applicant and the NSLDS financial aid history page. In addition, if a school disburses Title IV\nfunds to a student with a comment code that requires resolution and the student withdraws before the school has\nresolved the underlying issue, any funds disbursed must be returned to ED since the funds were provided to an otherwise\nineligible student. For other problems, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will show that the FAFSA form has been rejected and no SAI\nhas been calculated. The FAFSA Submission Summary will tell the applicant how to resolve the reject by correcting errors\nor providing consent and approval, signatures, or more information. A complete list of comments, C Flags, reject codes,\nand required resolutions are available in Volume 7 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide. A valid output document (ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary) is one on which all the information reported on a student9s\nFAFSA form is accurate and complete as of the date the application is signed. Valid Output Document\n34 CFR 668.2(b)",
        "This is to enhance security, privacy, and to\nreduce the risk of the misuse of sensitive data. However, you (the financial aid administrator) will be able to see the\ntransferred data on the ISIR. Schools and other partners that receive ISIRs must protect federal student aid information\nprovided to them by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the application, award, and administration of the\nfederal student aid programs as permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA, as amended. In keeping with the\nexpectation that you protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, you must not disclose FTI\nfrom the FAFSA form unless the disclosure and use is permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA 1098h. For additional\ninformation and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34. Signatures\nEach student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS\nand (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per\napplication cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a\nprocessed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is\naccurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction\nto contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating\nthat the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their\nFAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect\nthe necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature\nrequirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval.",
        "Chapter 1\nThe Application Process: FAFSA to ISIR\nThe laws governing the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs require that a person apply for aid with a form provided by\nthe U.S. Department of Education (ED, Department) and that no fee be charged for processing it.",
        "The FPS also checks the application for possible inconsistencies and mistakes. For instance, if a dependent student\nreported the parents9 marital status as married but reported the family size as <2,= the edit checks would catch the\ninconsistency. Even when data is inconsistent, the FPS may be able to calculate an SAI based on assumptions. Students\nwho submit applications online will be able to correct or confirm FPS edits before submitting the application. Output Documents\nAfter processing is complete, the FPS produces output documents 3 the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) and\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary 3 that show the information the student originally provided, the SAI, results of the\neligibility matches, information about aid history, and information about any inconsistencies identified through the FPS\nedits. If the FPS was unable to calculate an SAI, the output record will not show one. The ISIR is made available\nelectronically to the schools the student listed on the FAFSA form (or added later) and their state agency. The FAFSA\nSubmission Summary is made available to the student online or a paper FAFSA Submission Summary is mailed to the\nstudent if the student is unable to access it online.",
        "An online application received after June 30, 2026, will\nnot be processed. A paper application received before the application opens for the award year, or after June 30, 2026, will be returned\nunprocessed with a letter of explanation. If it is signed before and received after the application opens for the award year,\nit will be accepted but the student will receive a rejected FAFSA Submission Summary asking them to date and re-sign the\nFAFSA Submission Summary and return it for processing. For other deadlines pertaining to corrections, changes, disbursements, and verification, see the official deadline notice for\nthe 2025-26 award year. It will provide all the processing deadline dates and will be available in the Knowledge Center\nunder <Federal Registers.= For these deadlines, the date the FPS processed the ISIR transaction is the date the institution\nreceived the ISIR. The processed date is displayed above the SAI on the first page of the FAFSA Submission Summary and\nISIR printout. Students who submit the FAFSA form later in the award year can receive aid for the entire year, including completed\npayment periods, if they were not ineligible at the time.

Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler. IRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution.

A pending username and password that has not been verified will still\nallow the user to access and submit the online FAFSA form and complete other limited actions on StudentAid.gov.

For this\nreason, we recommend that users do not sign and submit the online FAFSA form until the account username and\npassword is verified through a match with the SSA. If the SSN match is unsuccessful, the account is not considered verified, and an email is sent to notify the individual that\nthey should review the information they provided (name, date of birth, and SSN) to ensure it is accurate.

The redisclosure of FTI by the Department to an eligible institution, state higher education agency, or a designated\nscholarship organization (e.g., institutional or state financial aid). Only the Department has the authority to obtain approval and consent for the use and disclosure of FTI for such purposes. Our partners (FAAs, advocates, etc.) are not permitted to obtain approval and consent on behalf of FAFSA contributors\n(including parent(s) or spouse) for the use and disclosure of FTI. Once a FAFSA contributor has provided consent and approval for use and disclosure of FTI for a FAFSA cycle (e.g., the\n2025-26 FAFSA cycle), they cannot revoke consent for that cycle. The ability to revoke consent is not needed for FAFSA\npurposes because the FAFSA contributor is providing a one-time consent for a specific tax year and an annual consent is\nrequired for each FAFSA cycle. Students and contributors are not able to view or edit the imported FTI data.",

        "However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form. FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form. Consent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper). To provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department. FAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",

IRS Response Codes\nThe IRS will provide one of the following response codes for each contributor, and they will appear on a student9s ISIR. Code\nIndication\n200\nUsable FTI data retrieved successfully\n214\nNo return on file\n203\n206\n212\nNo usable FTI data retrieved\nThe IRS provides a response code value of <200= when the IRS has data and it was successfully shared with FSA for\ninclusion on the applicant9s FAFSA form. Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler. IRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution. Contributors\n<Contributor= refers to anyone who is required to provide information, consent, and approval, and a signature on the\nFAFSA form.",
        "This is to enhance security, privacy, and to\nreduce the risk of the misuse of sensitive data. However, you (the financial aid administrator) will be able to see the\ntransferred data on the ISIR. Schools and other partners that receive ISIRs must protect federal student aid information\nprovided to them by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the application, award, and administration of the\nfederal student aid programs as permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA, as amended. In keeping with the\nexpectation that you protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, you must not disclose FTI\nfrom the FAFSA form unless the disclosure and use is permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA 1098h. For additional\ninformation and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34. Signatures\nEach student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS\nand (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per\napplication cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a\nprocessed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is\naccurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction\nto contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating\nthat the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their\nFAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect\nthe necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature\nrequirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval.",

        "Application and Verification Guide\nIntroduction\nThis guide is intended for college financial aid administrators and counselors who help students with the financial aid\nprocess4completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, verifying information, and making\ncorrections and other changes to the information reported on the FAFSA form. Throughout the Federal Student Aid Handbook, we use <college,= <school,= and <institution= interchangeably unless a\nmore specific use is given. Similarly, <student,= <applicant,= and <aid recipient= are synonyms. <Parents= in this volume\nrefers to the legal parents of dependent students, and <you= refers to the primary audience of the Handbook: financial aid\nadministrators at colleges. <We= indicates the U.S. Department of Education (the Department, ED), and <federal student\naid= and <Title IV aid= are synonymous terms for the financial aid offered by the Department. We appreciate any comments that you have on the Application and Verification Guide (AVG), as well as all the volumes of\nthe FSA Handbook. We revise the text based on questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please\nreach out to us about how to improve the FSA Handbook through the <Contact Customer Support= feature in our Partner\nConnect Help Center clicking on <FSA Handbook= under the Topic section. FAFSA Simplification Act\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a\nsignificant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need\nanalysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the\nFAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for\nEducation (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process. Changes From the FUTURE Act\nThe Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data\nexchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate\ncompleting the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data\nRetrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX\neliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information\nreported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered\nverified for Title IV purposes. Unlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s\nspouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via\nthe FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid. Other Changes\nThroughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references\nhave been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year.

After the student receives confirmation that SSA has corrected its records, the student must contact the\nFederal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) and ask them to manually sync their data with SSA. Alternatively, if the\nstudent notifies the school that they received confirmation from SSA, the FAA may update the Resend to Matches field to\n<Y= in the FAFSA Partner Portal and submit it as a correction so the transaction can go back to SSA for an updated match\nflag.

For additional\ninformation and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34. Signatures\nEach student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS\nand (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per\napplication cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a\nprocessed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is\naccurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction\nto contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating\nthat the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their\nFAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect\nthe necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature\nrequirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval.",
        "However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form. FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form. Consent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper). To provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department. FAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",
        "For example, a contributor would be required to manually report income and tax data if they were\nmarried and filed their 2023 U.S. tax return jointly with their spouse but are now divorced. IRS Response Codes\nThe IRS will provide one of the following response codes for each contributor, and they will appear on a student9s ISIR. Code\nIndication\n200\nUsable FTI data retrieved successfully\n214\nNo return on file\n203\n206\n212\nNo usable FTI data retrieved\nThe IRS provides a response code value of <200= when the IRS has data and it was successfully shared with FSA for\ninclusion on the applicant9s FAFSA form. Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler. IRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution. Contributors\n<Contributor= refers to anyone who is required to provide information, consent, and approval, and a signature on the\nFAFSA form."

      "response": "The definition of a parent on the FAFSA is relevant for students with unmarried biological parents living together because it determines whether the student needs to provide parental information and how they are classified for financial aid purposes. Specifically, if the student's unmarried biological parents are living together and both support the student or the student’s dependent who qualifies, the student may be required to report both parents' financial information unless the student qualifies as independent for other reasons.\n\nFrom the guidance, a student living with their unmarried parents who are supporting them may or may not be considered dependent, depending on the specifics of their living arrangements and support. For example, if the parents are supporting the student and providing more than 50% support, and the student lives with them, the student typically would submit parental financial information. Conversely, if the student can demonstrate independence—such as supporting themselves financially or meeting other criteria—the need to include parental information may be waived.\n\nIn summary, the definition of parents as \"legal parents\" affects whether their financial information must be included on the FAFSA. For students with unmarried biological parents living together, understanding this definition helps clarify the dependency status and the required parental data to accurately complete the form.",

        "The student pays\n$1,500 per month to support their partner. The partner also has earned income of $2,000 per month and receives\n$200 per month from their parents. The partner uses all of this for their support. The student cannot consider their\npartner a legal dependent since the $1,500 they provide is not more than half of the partner9s total support of\n$3,700. AVG, Chapter 2, Example 5: In April 2025, a student applies for aid for both 2024-25 and 2025-26 award years. One month prior to that, their parent moved in with the student. The parent is undocumented and does not work\nor qualify to receive other federal benefits. Even though the student provides all their parent9s support, the\nmonths of support for March through June 2025 (the end of the 2024-25 award year) would not be more than 50%\nfor 2024-25 award year. Therefore, the student cannot claim their parent as a legal dependent on their 2024-25\nFAFSA form. If the parent had moved in before the midpoint of the year, the student would have been able to\ncount the parent as a dependent for 2024-25. However, because the two plan to live together and the student\nplans to provide more than 50% support at least through June 2026, the student can count the parent as a\ndependent for 2025-26. AVG, Chapter 2, Example 6: A student lives alone with their infant child. The infant child9s other parent pays\n$200 per month in child support to the student. The student also receives the equivalent of $500 per month from\ngovernment assistance programs for the child. The student provides the remainder of the child9s support through\npart-time work. The student can consider the child a legal dependent as they live together and the student\nprovides more than 50% of the child9s support. AVG, Chapter 2, Example 7: A student lives alone with their infant child. The child9s other parent shares\ncustody of the child and pays $1,000 per month in child support to the student. The student receives the\nequivalent of $500 per month from government assistance programs for the child. The student does not work and\nrelies on the child support and government assistance to support the child. The student cannot consider the child\na legal dependent, even though the child lives with the student, because the student does not provide more than\n50% of the child9s support. If the student is not otherwise independent, the student will need to provide parent\ninformation on the FAFSA form. If the child9s other parent is also a student, they could consider the child a legal\ndependent on their FAFSA form if the child lived with them and they provide more than 50% of the child9s support.",
        "The FAFSA form is organized by contributor. Each contributor will complete their own section of the form\nwhich contains specific questions and instructions pertaining to that contributor. The guidance in this chapter\nsupplements those instructions and explains why some of the questions are needed on the FAFSA form. The following sections discuss the questions found within each contributor section on the FAFSA form. The parents\nmentioned are the legal parents of dependent students. The numbers in parentheses are for the items as they appear on\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary, ISIR, paper (PDF) FAFSA, and FAFSA Partner Portal.

        "See Volume 1, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook for definitions of undergraduate and graduate students. Student Personal (5), Homelessness (6), or Unusual (7) Circumstances\nThe law governing the Title IV programs is based on the premise that the family is the first source of the student9s\nsupport, and the law provides several criteria that decide if the student is considered independent of their parents for aid\neligibility. Note that a student reaching the age of 18 or 21 or living apart from their parents does not on its own affect\ntheir dependency status. Questions 5 and 6, along with information from other FAFSA questions, are used to determine if a student meets eligibility\ncriteria to be considered independent and not required to submit information about their parents. If a student is\nconsidered a dependent of their parents, the parents' must include their financial information on the FAFSA form. The FPS\nwill calculate a parent contribution and add it to the student9s contribution to derive an SAI. For the 2025-26 year, a student who meets one or more of the following criteria is independent:\nFrom Question 1:\nUndergraduate student definition\n34 CFR 668.2(b) <Undergraduate student=\nGraduate student definition\n34 CFR 668.2(b) <Graduate or professional student=",
        "Once the error is corrected, you\nmay request to resend the application to agency matches on the FAFSA Partner Portal. A subsequent transaction will then\nreprocess the match with the VA. If the student is not a veteran and will not be one by June 30, 2026, they must correct their answer to Question 5 and\ninvite at least one parent to contribute to their FAFSA form. Children and Legal Dependents\nStudents who have legal dependents are independent. Legal dependents include children or other people (except a\nspouse) who meet all the following criteria:\nThey live with the student (or, in the case of children, live apart from the student due to a qualifying temporary\nabsence under IRS code, such as living apart due to college enrollment). They currently receive more than half of their support from the student. They will continue to receive more than half of their support from the student between July 1, 2025, and June 30,\n2026\nIf one or both of a student9s parents are directly or indirectly providing more than 50% support in cash or other assistance\nto the student9s child, then the student could not claim to have a legal dependent who receives more than half of their\nsupport from the student. <Indirect support= includes support that a parent gives to the student on behalf of the child. If\nthe student is living with a parent who is paying for most of the household expenses, the parent would usually be\nconsidered the primary source of support to the student9s child, and the student should not indicate they have legal\ndependents. However, there may be some cases where the student can demonstrate that they provide more than half of\ntheir child9s support even while living at home with their parents, in which case the student could indicate they have legal\ndependents. If the student receives money or other support for the legal dependent from sources other than their parents, the student\nmay count it as part of their support to the child. Sources include government programs, such as Temporary Assistance\nfor Needy Families (TANF) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), that provide benefits for dependent\nchildren. So, a student may be considered independent when the benefit they receive is the primary support for the child.",
        "armed forces. The student has children or dependents other than a spouse (see note below for an explanation of why an individual\nmay not be asked this question, even if they appear to have children or dependents included in their family size). The student is (or was at any time after reaching the age of 13) an orphan, ward of the court, or in foster care. The student is (or was when the student reached the age of majority) a legally emancipated minor or in a legal\nguardianship (with someone other than their parent or stepparent), as determined by a court in the student9s state of\nlegal residence. From Question 6:\nThe student was at any time on or after July 1, 2024, determined to be unaccompanied and (1) homeless or (2) self-\nsupporting and at risk of being homeless with a determination from one of the entities listed on the FAFSA form. In unusual circumstances, an aid administrator can determine that a student who doesn9t meet any of the criteria listed\nabove should still be treated as an independent student. A student may indicate that they have an unusual circumstance\nby selecting <Yes= to Question 7 on the FAFSA form. The student may then skip the parent sections of the form. Students\nwho select <Yes= to this question will be given provisional independent student status and directed to provide\ndocumentation to their financial aid office for determination. (See <Unusual Circumstances= in Chapter 5.)\nActive Duty in the U.S. Armed Forces\nNote: The FAFSA Simplification Act required ED to limit or eliminate unnecessary questions from the FAFSA form. If the answer to a question is not necessary to determine a student9s eligibility for federal student aid or if the\nanswer is available or derivable from answers to other questions, the Department is not permitted to require the\nstudent to provide an answer. For example, when completing the FAFSA form online, applicants are only asked if they have children or\ndependents other than a spouse if they are under the age of 24. A student aged 24 or older will not have the\nopportunity to answer this question as they are independent by age, making this question unnecessary. In FPP,\nthe answer to this question will be <Blank=; on the student9s ISIR, the answer to this question will be <No=. Therefore, you should not assume that a <Blank= or <No= indicates the student does not have children or other\ndependents. It is possible for an applicant to have a <No= or <Blank= response to this question and report a family\nsize that appears to include dependents other than a spouse. This is not, on its own, conflicting information.",
        "Additionally, the student may or may not be independent, depending on their responses to other\ndependency questions. AVG, Chapter 2, Example 3: A student is appointed legal guardian of their minor cousin, who lives with the\nstudent. The cousin receives Social Security benefits, which are paid to the student since the cousin is a minor. These benefits provide more than half of the cousin9s support. Because the cousin lives with and is supported by\nthe student (through the Social Security benefits) throughout the award year, the student indicates they have a\nlegal dependent on the FAFSA form and is an independent student. However, if the cousin did not live with the\nstudent, the student can't indicate they have a legal dependent and would only be independent if they meet other\nindependent circumstances. AVG, Chapter 2, Example 4: A student and their partner live together but are not married.",
        "However, child support received from a noncustodial parent cannot be counted as part of the student9s support to the\nchild. When a student completes a FAFSA form after the award year has begun and indicates they have a legal dependent who\nis not the student9s child, the support already given by the student during the award year plus the future support for the\nremainder of the award year must total more than 50% for the whole award year for the individual to meet the definition\nof a legal dependent. Legal Dependent Examples\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 1: A student and their disabled sibling currently live together. The sibling receives a\nsmall disability payment each month, but the student provides more than 50% support for the sibling and expects\nto continue to do so through the award year. The sibling is considered a dependent of the student and can be\nincluded in the student9s family size on the FAFSA form. The student is also an independent student due to having\na legal dependent. AVG, Chapter 2, Example 2: The same student and disabled sibling currently live together and expect to\ncontinue to do so through the award year. The sibling receives a small disability payment AND a pension payment\neach month. The combination of the pension and the disability payment will be enough that the student won9t be",
        "equal the tax filer(s) plus dependents) claimed on an individual9s tax return. Individuals who complete the FAFSA form\nonline, provide the required consent and approval to retrieve and use IRS FTI, and have their tax data successfully\ntransferred via the FA-DDX will not be asked to report the size of their family as their family size will be derived from that\nFTI. Instead, these individuals will be asked if their family size is different from the number of individuals claimed on their\ntax return. If they indicate there was a change, they will be asked to manually report their number of dependents in a\nfollow-up question. On the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, family size appears in both the student and parent contributor sections. Dependent\nstudents are instructed to skip Question 9 on the paper (PDF) FAFSA form. Dependent students completing the online\nFAFSA form will not see the family size question in the student section. The following persons are included in the family size of an independent student:\nThe student and their spouse, unless the spouse has died or is not living in the household due to separation or\ndivorce. The student9s dependent children, if they live with the student (or live apart from the student due to a qualifying\ntemporary absence under IRS code, such as living apart due to college enrollment) and will receive more than half of\ntheir support from the student (and spouse) from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026. Unborn children should not be\nincluded in the family size, though the family size can be updated if the child is born and will receive more than half\nof their support from the student (and spouse) during the award year. Other persons, who live with and receive more than half their support from the student and will receive more than\nhalf support for the entire award year. For FAFSA forms submitted after the start of the year, see the relevant\nparagraph and example about legal dependents provided earlier in this chapter under the <Children and Legal\nDependents= section. Number in College (10)\nWhile number in college is no longer used to calculate a student9s SAI, the FAFSA Simplification Act requires the question\nto be included on the FAFSA form. Schools can use the information provided to perform a special circumstance adjustment\nfor a student.",
        "They will be used for research purposes only. Student Citizenship (13)\nFamily Size Example\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 8: A married student recently separated from their spouse, and they are no longer\nliving together. They have a child together who is currently living with the student9s spouse. The student is paying\nchild support to the spouse, but it isn9t enough to provide more than half the child9s support. The spouse and child\ncannot be included in the student9s family size, even though the student and spouse are not yet legally divorced. However, the student9s nephew lives with the student and receives more than half of their support from the\nstudent (and will do so for the award year). The student can count the nephew in their family size, which is two. The nephew, who recently turned 24, is an independent student on his own FAFSA form and his household size is\none.",
        "Incarcerated students should use an address where they can reliably receive mail. This may be the physical address\nof the facility they are in, the address of the school (if permitted by the school), or a central processing facility used\nby the facility for mail distribution. If a prison ID number is required by the facility for the applicant to receive mail,\nthe applicant should list that at the end of the address field. If an incarcerated student is released, they should also\nupdate their address in their StudentAid.gov account or on their FAFSA Submission Summary. Homeless students should use a mailing address where they can reliably receive mail. That can be the address of a\nrelative or friend who has given them permission to use it, or it can be their school9s address if they have contacted\nthe school for permission and instructions on how mail they receive at the school will reach them. As soon as\nhomeless students have more permanent housing, they should update their address in their StudentAid.gov account\nor on their FAFSA Submission Summary. If the student provides an email address, they should get an email with a link to their online FAFSA Submission Summary\nwithin one to three days after the FPS receives the completed application. The Department will also use this email address\nto correspond with the student regarding their application. Student Current Marital Status (3)\nThis is marital status <as of today= 3 the day the application is signed. Marital status cannot be projected. It can be\nupdated in limited circumstances; see Chapter 4. A student who is only engaged should select <single (never married)= unless they wait until after their marriage date to\ncomplete the FAFSA form. A student in a relationship that meets the criteria for common-law marriage in their state of\nlegal residence should select <married= and will be considered independent. A student who is separated from their spouse\nshould select <separated= and will be considered a dependent student for FAFSA purposes, unless they meet other criteria\nto be considered an independent student.

      "question": "How does the FAFSA form address situations where a student's parent has a unique tax filing status, such as not filing a U.S. tax return due to foreign income or other reasons?",
      "response": "The FAFSA form primarily requires a valid U.S. Social Security Number (SSN) for individuals to apply for federal student aid. If a student's parent has a unique tax filing status, such as not filing a U.S. tax return—possibly due to foreign income or other reasons—the form addresses this in a few ways:\n\n1. **IRS Response Codes:**  \n   The IRS provides response codes indicating the status of the tax filing:\n   - **Code 200:** Usable Federal Tax Information (FTI) successfully retrieved.\n   - **Code 214:** No return on file, meaning the individual did not file a U.S. tax return.\n   - Other codes (e.g., 203, 206, 212): IRS unable to provide FTI, requiring the individual to manually enter income and tax data.\n\n2. **For a parent not filing a U.S. tax return:**  \n   If the IRS response code is 214, indicating no U.S. tax return on file, the parent must manually report income and tax information on the FAFSA. The IRS response code of 214 essentially confirms that no U.S. tax data is available for that individual, irrespective of their foreign income or filing status.\n\n3. **Foreign Income or Non-Filing:**  \n   The FAFSA form does not automatically accept foreign income or non-filing status as an alternative to U.S. tax filings. Instead, in cases where the IRS does not have data (response code 214), the applicant must provide income and tax data manually. This manually entered information is used in the financial aid calculation but is not verified by the IRS.\n\n4. **Special Circumstances and Verification:**  \n   In situations where a parent has a unique tax situation—such as foreign income or not filing a U.S. return—the student or parent can provide documentation and explanation to their financial aid office. The aid administrator can then consider these circumstances in their aid determination process.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe FAFSA form handles situations where a parent does not file a U.S. tax return by requiring manual reporting of income and tax information if the IRS cannot provide verified data (indicated by IRS response code 214). The form does not have a specific special status for foreign income or non-filers but relies on manual data input and documentation in such cases.",

        "The FAFSA form is organized by contributor. Each contributor will complete their own section of the form\nwhich contains specific questions and instructions pertaining to that contributor. The guidance in this chapter\nsupplements those instructions and explains why some of the questions are needed on the FAFSA form. The following sections discuss the questions found within each contributor section on the FAFSA form. The parents\nmentioned are the legal parents of dependent students. The numbers in parentheses are for the items as they appear on\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary, ISIR, paper (PDF) FAFSA, and FAFSA Partner Portal. The FAFSA form is considered a\n<snapshot= of the family9s information as of the date the application is signed and it can be updated only in certain\ncircumstances and only for certain items. See Chapter 4 for more information about updating a FAFSA form. Contributor: Student\nThis section consists of 24 questions related to the student. Student Identity Information (1)\nThis question requests the name, date of birth, and Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification\nNumber (ITIN) of the student contributor. The name, with other identifying information, is used for several data matches.",

The student has children or dependents other than a spouse (see note below for an explanation of why an individual\nmay not be asked this question, even if they appear to have children or dependents included in their family size). The student is (or was at any time after reaching the age of 13) an orphan, ward of the court, or in foster care. The student is (or was when the student reached the age of majority) a legally emancipated minor or in a legal\nguardianship (with someone other than their parent or stepparent), as determined by a court in the student9s state of\nlegal residence. From Question 6:\nThe student was at any time on or after July 1, 2024, determined to be unaccompanied and (1) homeless or (2) self-\nsupporting and at risk of being homeless with a determination from one of the entities listed on the FAFSA form. In unusual circumstances, an aid administrator can determine that a student who doesn9t meet any of the criteria listed\nabove should still be treated as an independent student. A student may indicate that they have an unusual circumstance\nby selecting <Yes= to Question 7 on the FAFSA form. The student may then skip the parent sections of the form. Students\nwho select <Yes= to this question will be given provisional independent student status and directed to provide\ndocumentation to their financial aid office for determination. (See <Unusual Circumstances= in Chapter 5.)\nActive Duty in the U.S. Armed Forces\nNote: The FAFSA Simplification Act required ED to limit or eliminate unnecessary questions from the FAFSA form. If the answer to a question is not necessary to determine a student9s eligibility for federal student aid or if the\nanswer is available or derivable from answers to other questions, the Department is not permitted to require the\nstudent to provide an answer. For example, when completing the FAFSA form online, applicants are only asked if they have children or\ndependents other than a spouse if they are under the age of 24. A student aged 24 or older will not have the\nopportunity to answer this question as they are independent by age, making this question unnecessary. In FPP,\nthe answer to this question will be <Blank=; on the student9s ISIR, the answer to this question will be <No=. Therefore, you should not assume that a <Blank= or <No= indicates the student does not have children or other\ndependents. It is possible for an applicant to have a <No= or <Blank= response to this question and report a family\nsize that appears to include dependents other than a spouse. This is not, on its own, conflicting information.",

Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler. IRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution.

Instead, these individuals will be asked if their family size is different from the number of individuals claimed on their\ntax return. If they indicate there was a change, they will be asked to manually report their number of dependents in a\nfollow-up question. On the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, family size appears in both the student and parent contributor sections. Dependent\nstudents are instructed to skip Question 9 on the paper (PDF) FAFSA form. Dependent students completing the online\nFAFSA form will not see the family size question in the student section. The following persons are included in the family size of an independent student:\nThe student and their spouse, unless the spouse has died or is not living in the household due to separation or\ndivorce. The student9s dependent children, if they live with the student (or live apart from the student due to a qualifying\ntemporary absence under IRS code, such as living apart due to college enrollment) and will receive more than half of\ntheir support from the student (and spouse) from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026.

A pending username and password that has not been verified will still\nallow the user to access and submit the online FAFSA form and complete other limited actions on StudentAid.gov. However, the Department will not be able to retrieve federal tax data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For this\nreason, we recommend that users do not sign and submit the online FAFSA form until the account username and\npassword is verified through a match with the SSA. If the SSN match is unsuccessful, the account is not considered verified, and an email is sent to notify the individual that\nthey should review the information they provided (name, date of birth, and SSN) to ensure it is accurate. If the applicant\nused an unverified account username and password to sign their FAFSA form, the applicant is also sent a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary requesting all required signatures. TransUnion® Knowledge-Based Identity Verification\nUsers who create a StudentAid.gov account without an SSN will be required to complete a knowledge-based identity\nverification process with TransUnion® to verify their identity and provide login credentials. The student (if a citizen of one\nof the Freely Associated States - the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, or the Federated States of\nMicronesia), student9s spouse, parent, or parent spouse/partner are sent through the TransUnion® process when they do\nnot have an SSN and check the <I don9t have an SSN= box during the account creation process.

FAFSA Filers Under the Age of 13\nBecause the Children9s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 prohibits any entity, including a government\nagency, from electronically conducting business or communicating with a person under age 13, applicants who are 12 or\nyounger cannot complete the FAFSA form online.

        "See Volume 1, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook for definitions of undergraduate and graduate students. Student Personal (5), Homelessness (6), or Unusual (7) Circumstances\nThe law governing the Title IV programs is based on the premise that the family is the first source of the student9s\nsupport, and the law provides several criteria that decide if the student is considered independent of their parents for aid\neligibility. Note that a student reaching the age of 18 or 21 or living apart from their parents does not on its own affect\ntheir dependency status. Questions 5 and 6, along with information from other FAFSA questions, are used to determine if a student meets eligibility\ncriteria to be considered independent and not required to submit information about their parents. If a student is\nconsidered a dependent of their parents, the parents' must include their financial information on the FAFSA form. The FPS\nwill calculate a parent contribution and add it to the student9s contribution to derive an SAI. For the 2025-26 year, a student who meets one or more of the following criteria is independent:\nFrom Question 1:\nUndergraduate student definition\n34 CFR 668.2(b) <Undergraduate student=\nGraduate student definition\n34 CFR 668.2(b) <Graduate or professional student=",
        "Examples of eligible noncitizen categories are given in the FAFSA instructions, and a detailed discussion of citizenship\nissues can be found in Volume 1 of the FSA Handbook. Only U.S. citizens or certain classes of noncitizens are eligible for\nTitle IV aid; however, other students can still submit the FAFSA form because they might be eligible for aid from\ninstitutional, state, or private sources that do not have the same requirements but use FAFSA information. Students who select <Eligible noncitizen= should include their A-Number, if they have one. Student State of Legal Residence (14)\nThis is used to determine which poverty guideline to use when evaluating eligibility for a Maximum or Minimum Pell Grant\nfor an independent student. This is also used to determine which state agency should receive the student9s FAFSA information. States have varying\ncriteria for determining whether the student is a resident for purposes of their financial aid. However, residing in one state\nfor five years (or more) will meet any state9s criteria. Parent Education Status (15)\nSome state agencies and institutions use this information to award grants and scholarships. Parent Killed in the Line of Duty (16)\nA student may be eligible for a Maximum Pell Grant if they have a parent or guardian who died in the line of duty while\neither (1) serving on active duty as a member of the U.S. armed forces on or after September 11, 2001, or (2) performing\nofficial duties as a public safety officer.

This may be the physical address\nof the facility they are in, the address of the school (if permitted by the school), or a central processing facility used\nby the facility for mail distribution. If a prison ID number is required by the facility for the applicant to receive mail,\nthe applicant should list that at the end of the address field. If an incarcerated student is released, they should also\nupdate their address in their StudentAid.gov account or on their FAFSA Submission Summary. Homeless students should use a mailing address where they can reliably receive mail. That can be the address of a\nrelative or friend who has given them permission to use it, or it can be their school9s address if they have contacted\nthe school for permission and instructions on how mail they receive at the school will reach them.

Student Current Marital Status (3)\nThis is marital status <as of today= 3 the day the application is signed. Marital status cannot be projected.

        "Chapter 2: Filling Out the FAFSA\nWe added a section on signatures which describes the appropriate use of the signature page from the FAFSA Partner\nPortal (FPP).

We updated the tax line number used for education credits to IRS Form 1040: line 29 + IRS Form 1040 Schedule 3:\nline 3. We moved the section on foreign earned income exclusion to Chapter 5. We expanded <Parent Tax Filing Status (37)= section to explain the six answer options on the FAFSA form and when\neach answer should be selected.

The student has children or dependents other than a spouse (see note below for an explanation of why an individual\nmay not be asked this question, even if they appear to have children or dependents included in their family size). The student is (or was at any time after reaching the age of 13) an orphan, ward of the court, or in foster care.

For example, when completing the FAFSA form online, applicants are only asked if they have children or\ndependents other than a spouse if they are under the age of 24. A student aged 24 or older will not have the\nopportunity to answer this question as they are independent by age, making this question unnecessary. In FPP,\nthe answer to this question will be <Blank=; on the student9s ISIR, the answer to this question will be <No=. Therefore, you should not assume that a <Blank= or <No= indicates the student does not have children or other\ndependents. It is possible for an applicant to have a <No= or <Blank= response to this question and report a family\nsize that appears to include dependents other than a spouse. This is not, on its own, conflicting information.",
        "You will receive an ISIR for the student only if the applicant includes your school on their FAFSA form. If your school is not\nlisted, you can request an ISIR for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal by adding your federal school code if you\nhave the applicant9s Data Release Number (DRN), which authorizes your access to the student9s application information. The DRN appears on the FAFSA Submission Summary, on the FAFSA confirmation page, and in the FAFSA confirmation\nemail. You are required to receive ISIRs and to accept FAFSA Submission Summaries from students, but you cannot require\nstudents to submit FAFSA Submission Summaries to receive aid. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student, your federal\nschool code must be added to their record so that an ISIR is sent to you. We recommend making corrections electronically\nvia the online FAFSA (the student) or the FAFSA Partner Portal (the school); however, students can also use a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary to make corrections. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student who provided a FAFSA Submission\nSummary, you must use the FAFSA Submission Summary to package and disburse the student aid. Again, you must also\nensure that your school code is added to the student9s FPS record (see the <How to Submit Corrections and Updates=\nsection in Chapter 4). The FAFSA Submission Summaries and ISIRs include comment codes and text explaining any questionable results from\nFAFSA processing. Some comment codes also have an associated C Flag, which you must resolve before paying the\nstudent aid. If a student9s FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR contains a comment code that requires resolution, the\nunderlying issue must be resolved before any Title IV funds may be disbursed to the student. For instance, if an applicant\nhas defaulted on a federal student loan, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will note this in several places,\nincluding comments to the applicant and the NSLDS financial aid history page. In addition, if a school disburses Title IV\nfunds to a student with a comment code that requires resolution and the student withdraws before the school has\nresolved the underlying issue, any funds disbursed must be returned to ED since the funds were provided to an otherwise\nineligible student. For other problems, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will show that the FAFSA form has been rejected and no SAI\nhas been calculated. The FAFSA Submission Summary will tell the applicant how to resolve the reject by correcting errors\nor providing consent and approval, signatures, or more information. A complete list of comments, C Flags, reject codes,\nand required resolutions are available in Volume 7 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide. A valid output document (ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary) is one on which all the information reported on a student9s\nFAFSA form is accurate and complete as of the date the application is signed. Valid Output Document\n34 CFR 668.2(b)",
        "The FPS also checks the application for possible inconsistencies and mistakes. For instance, if a dependent student\nreported the parents9 marital status as married but reported the family size as <2,= the edit checks would catch the\ninconsistency. Even when data is inconsistent, the FPS may be able to calculate an SAI based on assumptions. Students\nwho submit applications online will be able to correct or confirm FPS edits before submitting the application. Output Documents\nAfter processing is complete, the FPS produces output documents 3 the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) and\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary 3 that show the information the student originally provided, the SAI, results of the\neligibility matches, information about aid history, and information about any inconsistencies identified through the FPS\nedits. If the FPS was unable to calculate an SAI, the output record will not show one. The ISIR is made available\nelectronically to the schools the student listed on the FAFSA form (or added later) and their state agency. The FAFSA\nSubmission Summary is made available to the student online or a paper FAFSA Submission Summary is mailed to the\nstudent if the student is unable to access it online.",

Translation assistance in additional languages is available by calling 1-833-610-\n2590 and pressing <7= to request a specific language. Account Username and Password (FSA ID)\nThe account username and password, also known as the FSA ID, is used to access a person9s StudentAid.gov account. It\nserves as an electronic signature and a digital identifier to allow access to various ED systems and services for students,\nspouses of students, parents, or spouses/partners of parents. Therefore, each individual must create their own account\nand should not share their login credentials with anyone, including FAAs. Users can create an account online at\nStudentAid.gov quickly and securely. See Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-123 for additional information on\ncreating a StudentAid.gov account for individuals without a Social Security number. Each person who provides data in the online FAFSA form must have an account username and password to access the\nform. In the past, a Social Security number (SSN) was required to create a StudentAid.gov account. Starting with the\n2024325 award year, all individuals4even those without an SSN4can create a StudentAid.gov account. Persons with an\nSSN will still have their information verified by the Social Security Administration (SSA), while those without an SSN will\nuse the TransUnion® knowledge-based identity verification process described below. The account username and password are created in real-time so that the student or other contributor can use it\nimmediately to enter the FAFSA form.

        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3. The easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported.",

A pending username and password that has not been verified will still\nallow the user to access and submit the online FAFSA form and complete other limited actions on StudentAid.gov. However, the Department will not be able to retrieve federal tax data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For this\nreason, we recommend that users do not sign and submit the online FAFSA form until the account username and\npassword is verified through a match with the SSA. If the SSN match is unsuccessful, the account is not considered verified, and an email is sent to notify the individual that\nthey should review the information they provided (name, date of birth, and SSN) to ensure it is accurate. If the applicant\nused an unverified account username and password to sign their FAFSA form, the applicant is also sent a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary requesting all required signatures. TransUnion® Knowledge-Based Identity Verification\nUsers who create a StudentAid.gov account without an SSN will be required to complete a knowledge-based identity\nverification process with TransUnion® to verify their identity and provide login credentials. The student (if a citizen of one\nof the Freely Associated States - the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, or the Federated States of\nMicronesia), student9s spouse, parent, or parent spouse/partner are sent through the TransUnion® process when they do\nnot have an SSN and check the <I don9t have an SSN= box during the account creation process. They will be asked to\nprovide additional information to confirm their identity. FAFSA Filers Under the Age of 13\nBecause the Children9s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 prohibits any entity, including a government\nagency, from electronically conducting business or communicating with a person under age 13, applicants who are 12 or\nyounger cannot complete the FAFSA form online. Instead, when they apply for financial aid, the student and required\ncontributor(s) can fill out the appropriate award year paper (PDF) FAFSA form and mail it to:\nFederal Student Aid Programs\nAttn: COPPA Process\n25 Air Park Drive\nLondon, KY 40744-8236\nSuch applicants should not provide an email address on the application or any correction that might follow.

The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler. IRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft).

However, the Department will not be able to retrieve federal tax data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For this\nreason, we recommend that users do not sign and submit the online FAFSA form until the account username and\npassword is verified through a match with the SSA. If the SSN match is unsuccessful, the account is not considered verified, and an email is sent to notify the individual that\nthey should review the information they provided (name, date of birth, and SSN) to ensure it is accurate. If the applicant\nused an unverified account username and password to sign their FAFSA form, the applicant is also sent a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary requesting all required signatures.

After the\nFAFSA form is submitted, it will be processed and a paper FAFSA Submission Summary will be sent to the student and an\nISIR will be sent to schools.",
        "You will receive an ISIR for the student only if the applicant includes your school on their FAFSA form. If your school is not\nlisted, you can request an ISIR for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal by adding your federal school code if you\nhave the applicant9s Data Release Number (DRN), which authorizes your access to the student9s application information. The DRN appears on the FAFSA Submission Summary, on the FAFSA confirmation page, and in the FAFSA confirmation\nemail. You are required to receive ISIRs and to accept FAFSA Submission Summaries from students, but you cannot require\nstudents to submit FAFSA Submission Summaries to receive aid. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student, your federal\nschool code must be added to their record so that an ISIR is sent to you. We recommend making corrections electronically\nvia the online FAFSA (the student) or the FAFSA Partner Portal (the school); however, students can also use a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary to make corrections. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student who provided a FAFSA Submission\nSummary, you must use the FAFSA Submission Summary to package and disburse the student aid. Again, you must also\nensure that your school code is added to the student9s FPS record (see the <How to Submit Corrections and Updates=\nsection in Chapter 4). The FAFSA Submission Summaries and ISIRs include comment codes and text explaining any questionable results from\nFAFSA processing. Some comment codes also have an associated C Flag, which you must resolve before paying the\nstudent aid. If a student9s FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR contains a comment code that requires resolution, the\nunderlying issue must be resolved before any Title IV funds may be disbursed to the student. For instance, if an applicant\nhas defaulted on a federal student loan, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will note this in several places,\nincluding comments to the applicant and the NSLDS financial aid history page. In addition, if a school disburses Title IV\nfunds to a student with a comment code that requires resolution and the student withdraws before the school has\nresolved the underlying issue, any funds disbursed must be returned to ED since the funds were provided to an otherwise\nineligible student. For other problems, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will show that the FAFSA form has been rejected and no SAI\nhas been calculated. The FAFSA Submission Summary will tell the applicant how to resolve the reject by correcting errors\nor providing consent and approval, signatures, or more information. A complete list of comments, C Flags, reject codes,\nand required resolutions are available in Volume 7 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide. A valid output document (ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary) is one on which all the information reported on a student9s\nFAFSA form is accurate and complete as of the date the application is signed. Valid Output Document\n34 CFR 668.2(b)",
        "This is to enhance security, privacy, and to\nreduce the risk of the misuse of sensitive data. However, you (the financial aid administrator) will be able to see the\ntransferred data on the ISIR. Schools and other partners that receive ISIRs must protect federal student aid information\nprovided to them by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the application, award, and administration of the\nfederal student aid programs as permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA, as amended. In keeping with the\nexpectation that you protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, you must not disclose FTI\nfrom the FAFSA form unless the disclosure and use is permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA 1098h. For additional\ninformation and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34. Signatures\nEach student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS\nand (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per\napplication cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a\nprocessed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is\naccurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction\nto contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating\nthat the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their\nFAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect\nthe necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature\nrequirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval.",
        "See Volume 1, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook for definitions of undergraduate and graduate students. Student Personal (5), Homelessness (6), or Unusual (7) Circumstances\nThe law governing the Title IV programs is based on the premise that the family is the first source of the student9s\nsupport, and the law provides several criteria that decide if the student is considered independent of their parents for aid\neligibility. Note that a student reaching the age of 18 or 21 or living apart from their parents does not on its own affect\ntheir dependency status. Questions 5 and 6, along with information from other FAFSA questions, are used to determine if a student meets eligibility\ncriteria to be considered independent and not required to submit information about their parents. If a student is\nconsidered a dependent of their parents, the parents' must include their financial information on the FAFSA form. The FPS\nwill calculate a parent contribution and add it to the student9s contribution to derive an SAI.

      "response": "A student should report taxable grants and scholarships on the FAFSA by manually entering the relevant income and tax information if IRS data cannot be retrieved automatically. When completing the FAFSA electronically, the student provides consent and approval for the Department of Education to obtain and use their IRS tax information (FTI) through the secure FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX), which pulls certain tax data directly from the IRS.\n\nThe role of IRS Form 1040 Schedule 1 in this process is that it provides specific tax information, such as taxable grants and scholarships, which can be imported automatically into the FAFSA if the data retrieval is successful. For example, updates mention that the FAFSA form now uses IRS Form 1040 line 29 and Schedule 3, line 3, to capture education-related income, including grants and scholarships that are taxable. \n\nIf IRS data retrieval is unsuccessful (indicated by certain response codes on the ISIR), the student or contributor must manually report their income and taxes on the FAFSA form. This manually entered information is used in calculating the Student Aid Index (SAI), but it is not verified through IRS data and may be subject to verification.\n\nIn summary, students are encouraged to use IRS data retrieved via Form 1040 Schedule 1 for reporting taxable grants and scholarships on the FAFSA. If IRS data cannot be obtained, they must manually report this information, which then plays a role in aid eligibility calculations but does not have the same level of verification.",

IRS Response Codes\nThe IRS will provide one of the following response codes for each contributor, and they will appear on a student9s ISIR. Code\nIndication\n200\nUsable FTI data retrieved successfully\n214\nNo return on file\n203\n206\n212\nNo usable FTI data retrieved\nThe IRS provides a response code value of <200= when the IRS has data and it was successfully shared with FSA for\ninclusion on the applicant9s FAFSA form. Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler. IRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution.

        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3. The easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported.",
        "This is to enhance security, privacy, and to\nreduce the risk of the misuse of sensitive data. However, you (the financial aid administrator) will be able to see the\ntransferred data on the ISIR. Schools and other partners that receive ISIRs must protect federal student aid information\nprovided to them by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the application, award, and administration of the\nfederal student aid programs as permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA, as amended. In keeping with the\nexpectation that you protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, you must not disclose FTI\nfrom the FAFSA form unless the disclosure and use is permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA 1098h. For additional\ninformation and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34. Signatures\nEach student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS\nand (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per\napplication cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a\nprocessed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is\naccurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction\nto contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating\nthat the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their\nFAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect\nthe necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature\nrequirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval.",
        "The FAFSA form is organized by contributor. Each contributor will complete their own section of the form\nwhich contains specific questions and instructions pertaining to that contributor. The guidance in this chapter\nsupplements those instructions and explains why some of the questions are needed on the FAFSA form. The following sections discuss the questions found within each contributor section on the FAFSA form. The parents\nmentioned are the legal parents of dependent students. The numbers in parentheses are for the items as they appear on\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary, ISIR, paper (PDF) FAFSA, and FAFSA Partner Portal. The FAFSA form is considered a\n<snapshot= of the family9s information as of the date the application is signed and it can be updated only in certain\ncircumstances and only for certain items. See Chapter 4 for more information about updating a FAFSA form. Contributor: Student\nThis section consists of 24 questions related to the student. Student Identity Information (1)\nThis question requests the name, date of birth, and Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification\nNumber (ITIN) of the student contributor. The name, with other identifying information, is used for several data matches.",
        "However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form. FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form. Consent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper). To provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department. FAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",
        "Chapter 1\nThe Application Process: FAFSA to ISIR\nThe laws governing the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs require that a person apply for aid with a form provided by\nthe U.S. Department of Education (ED, Department) and that no fee be charged for processing it.",

Individuals who complete the FAFSA form\nonline, provide the required consent and approval to retrieve and use IRS FTI, and have their tax data successfully\ntransferred via the FA-DDX will not be asked to report the size of their family as their family size will be derived from that\nFTI. Instead, these individuals will be asked if their family size is different from the number of individuals claimed on their\ntax return. If they indicate there was a change, they will be asked to manually report their number of dependents in a\nfollow-up question. On the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, family size appears in both the student and parent contributor sections. Dependent\nstudents are instructed to skip Question 9 on the paper (PDF) FAFSA form. Dependent students completing the online\nFAFSA form will not see the family size question in the student section. The following persons are included in the family size of an independent student:\nThe student and their spouse, unless the spouse has died or is not living in the household due to separation or\ndivorce. The student9s dependent children, if they live with the student (or live apart from the student due to a qualifying\ntemporary absence under IRS code, such as living apart due to college enrollment) and will receive more than half of\ntheir support from the student (and spouse) from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026. Unborn children should not be\nincluded in the family size, though the family size can be updated if the child is born and will receive more than half\nof their support from the student (and spouse) during the award year. Other persons, who live with and receive more than half their support from the student and will receive more than\nhalf support for the entire award year.

We expanded the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)= section to include subsections on (1) nontax filers, foreign\ncountries, and international organizations and (2) fiscal year tax returns. We updated the tax line number used for education credits to IRS Form 1040: line 29 + IRS Form 1040 Schedule 3:\nline 3. We moved the section on foreign earned income exclusion to Chapter 5. We expanded <Parent Tax Filing Status (37)= section to explain the six answer options on the FAFSA form and when\neach answer should be selected. This section also explains when an answer to this question might be conflicting\ninformation that requires resolution (comment code 303). Chapter 3: Student Aid Index (SAI) and Pell Grant Eligibility\nEdits to this chapter include general changes and updated links, but no significant changes or reorganization. Chapter 4: Verification, Updates, and Corrections\nWe added a note regarding the unavailability of the Verification of Identity functionality in the FPP and the flexibility\nthe Department provided around reporting timeframes.",
        "This form is the Free\nApplication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form. To be considered for federal student aid, a student must complete a FAFSA form. It collects financial and other information\nused to calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI; formerly Expected Family Contribution or EFC) and to determine a student9s\neligibility through computer matches with other agencies. The FAFSA form is the only application students must complete to apply for Title IV aid. A school cannot require extra\ninformation from students to package Title IV aid, except for verification, resolution of conflicting information, or\nprofessional judgment determinations. However, a school may require additional information for other purposes, such as\npackaging private or institutional aid. If the school collects additional information that affects Title IV eligibility, it must\ntake the information into account when awarding Title IV aid. Types of FAFSA Applications\nMore than 99% of FAFSA forms are filed electronically. However, there are other options for individuals unwilling or unable\nto file electronically. FAFSA Online\nImplementation of the FAFSA Simplification Act and the FUTURE Act required a complete overhaul of the FAFSA form,\nbeginning with the 2024-25 award year. Submitted FAFSA forms are sent directly to the FAFSA Processing System (FPS). Help is available for students online or by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-4-FED-AID\n(1-800-433-3243). There are many advantages to filing electronically, including:\nFaster processing;\nAvailability of online help;\nSkip logic, which allows applicants to skip over questions that don9t pertain to them; and\nFewer errors and rejected applications because internal and end-of-entry data edits ensure that required fields are\ncompleted and conflicts are resolved prior to submission. Paper (PDF) FAFSA Form\nThe paper (PDF) FAFSA form is available on StudentAid.gov. In future cycles, students will also be able to call the Federal\nStudent Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-433-3243 to request a single copy. The form can be printed and completed by hand, or by typing the data on the PDF before printing and mailing it. The\nmailing address is printed on the first page of the FAFSA form under <Mail Your FAFSA® Form=. The address changes\nannually, so use the address printed on the associated year9s FAFSA form. You must mail all fillable pages of the form (pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to\nthe applicant.",
        "2. The disclosure of their FTI by the IRS to the Department;\n3. The use of their FTI by a Department official to determine an applicant9s eligibility for federal student aid and the\namount for which they are eligible; and\n4. The redisclosure of FTI by the Department to an eligible institution, state higher education agency, or a designated\nscholarship organization (e.g., institutional or state financial aid). Only the Department has the authority to obtain approval and consent for the use and disclosure of FTI for such purposes. Our partners (FAAs, advocates, etc.) are not permitted to obtain approval and consent on behalf of FAFSA contributors\n(including parent(s) or spouse) for the use and disclosure of FTI. Once a FAFSA contributor has provided consent and approval for use and disclosure of FTI for a FAFSA cycle (e.g., the\n2025-26 FAFSA cycle), they cannot revoke consent for that cycle. The ability to revoke consent is not needed for FAFSA\npurposes because the FAFSA contributor is providing a one-time consent for a specific tax year and an annual consent is\nrequired for each FAFSA cycle. Students and contributors are not able to view or edit the imported FTI data."

      "response": "The FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) streamlines the FAFSA application process by enabling the automatic transfer of certain Federal Tax Information (FTI) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) directly into the FAFSA form. This is achieved through a secure, near-real-time connection established via an application programming interface (API) between IRS and the Federal Student Aid (FSA). Unlike the previous IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT), which applicants could opt into, the FA-DDX requires explicit consent and approval from the student and each contributor (such as parents or spouses) before the data can be retrieved. Once consent is provided, the IRS can share relevant tax information directly with the Department of Education, which then imports this data into the FAFSA, reducing the need for manual input of income and tax details.\n\nThe role of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), specifically amended Section 6103, is foundational to this process. The amendment authorizes the IRS to disclose certain tax return information (FTI) to the Department of Education in a secure manner, facilitating the automation of income verification for financial aid purposes. This legal framework ensures that the data sharing complies with privacy and confidentiality requirements while supporting the efficient processing of FAFSA applications.",

        "However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form. FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form. Consent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper). To provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department. FAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",
        "Application and Verification Guide\nIntroduction\nThis guide is intended for college financial aid administrators and counselors who help students with the financial aid\nprocess4completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, verifying information, and making\ncorrections and other changes to the information reported on the FAFSA form. Throughout the Federal Student Aid Handbook, we use <college,= <school,= and <institution= interchangeably unless a\nmore specific use is given. Similarly, <student,= <applicant,= and <aid recipient= are synonyms. <Parents= in this volume\nrefers to the legal parents of dependent students, and <you= refers to the primary audience of the Handbook: financial aid\nadministrators at colleges. <We= indicates the U.S. Department of Education (the Department, ED), and <federal student\naid= and <Title IV aid= are synonymous terms for the financial aid offered by the Department. We appreciate any comments that you have on the Application and Verification Guide (AVG), as well as all the volumes of\nthe FSA Handbook. We revise the text based on questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please\nreach out to us about how to improve the FSA Handbook through the <Contact Customer Support= feature in our Partner\nConnect Help Center clicking on <FSA Handbook= under the Topic section. FAFSA Simplification Act\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a\nsignificant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need\nanalysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the\nFAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for\nEducation (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process. Changes From the FUTURE Act\nThe Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data\nexchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate\ncompleting the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data\nRetrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX\neliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information\nreported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered\nverified for Title IV purposes. Unlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s\nspouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via\nthe FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid. Other Changes\nThroughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references\nhave been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year. Where appropriate, links and publications associated with FSA9s Partner Connect and Knowledge Center have been\nproperly updated. We also removed references to COVID-19 guidance and waivers. Some sections were moved to better align topics and assist with narrative flow.",
        "2. The disclosure of their FTI by the IRS to the Department;\n3. The use of their FTI by a Department official to determine an applicant9s eligibility for federal student aid and the\namount for which they are eligible; and\n4. The redisclosure of FTI by the Department to an eligible institution, state higher education agency, or a designated\nscholarship organization (e.g., institutional or state financial aid). Only the Department has the authority to obtain approval and consent for the use and disclosure of FTI for such purposes. Our partners (FAAs, advocates, etc.) are not permitted to obtain approval and consent on behalf of FAFSA contributors\n(including parent(s) or spouse) for the use and disclosure of FTI. Once a FAFSA contributor has provided consent and approval for use and disclosure of FTI for a FAFSA cycle (e.g., the\n2025-26 FAFSA cycle), they cannot revoke consent for that cycle. The ability to revoke consent is not needed for FAFSA\npurposes because the FAFSA contributor is providing a one-time consent for a specific tax year and an annual consent is\nrequired for each FAFSA cycle. Students and contributors are not able to view or edit the imported FTI data.",
        "This form is the Free\nApplication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form. To be considered for federal student aid, a student must complete a FAFSA form. It collects financial and other information\nused to calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI; formerly Expected Family Contribution or EFC) and to determine a student9s\neligibility through computer matches with other agencies. The FAFSA form is the only application students must complete to apply for Title IV aid. A school cannot require extra\ninformation from students to package Title IV aid, except for verification, resolution of conflicting information, or\nprofessional judgment determinations. However, a school may require additional information for other purposes, such as\npackaging private or institutional aid. If the school collects additional information that affects Title IV eligibility, it must\ntake the information into account when awarding Title IV aid. Types of FAFSA Applications\nMore than 99% of FAFSA forms are filed electronically. However, there are other options for individuals unwilling or unable\nto file electronically. FAFSA Online\nImplementation of the FAFSA Simplification Act and the FUTURE Act required a complete overhaul of the FAFSA form,\nbeginning with the 2024-25 award year. Submitted FAFSA forms are sent directly to the FAFSA Processing System (FPS). Help is available for students online or by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-4-FED-AID\n(1-800-433-3243). There are many advantages to filing electronically, including:\nFaster processing;\nAvailability of online help;\nSkip logic, which allows applicants to skip over questions that don9t pertain to them; and\nFewer errors and rejected applications because internal and end-of-entry data edits ensure that required fields are\ncompleted and conflicts are resolved prior to submission. Paper (PDF) FAFSA Form\nThe paper (PDF) FAFSA form is available on StudentAid.gov. In future cycles, students will also be able to call the Federal\nStudent Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-433-3243 to request a single copy. The form can be printed and completed by hand, or by typing the data on the PDF before printing and mailing it. The\nmailing address is printed on the first page of the FAFSA form under <Mail Your FAFSA® Form=. The address changes\nannually, so use the address printed on the associated year9s FAFSA form. You must mail all fillable pages of the form (pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to\nthe applicant.",

        "Extra postage will be\nrequired due to the size and/or weight of the mailing. FAFSA Partner Portal\nThe FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP) replaced FAA Access to CPS Online beginning with the 2024-25 award year. FSA\ndecommissioned the FAA Access site after the 2023324 application cycle closed. The FAFSA Partner Portal removed the ability for a financial aid administrator (FAA) to initiate a new application on behalf\nof a student. This is due to the requirement in the FUTURE Act that all FAFSA form contributors (including students,\nspouses, and parents) must provide their consent to disclose information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\napproval to retrieve and use certain Federal Tax Information (FTI). FAAs cannot provide consent and approval on behalf of\nany other person. Therefore, you will not be able to use the FPP to start and submit a new FAFSA form on an applicant9s\nbehalf.",
        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3. The easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported.",

Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler. IRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution. Contributors\n<Contributor= refers to anyone who is required to provide information, consent, and approval, and a signature on the\nFAFSA form."
