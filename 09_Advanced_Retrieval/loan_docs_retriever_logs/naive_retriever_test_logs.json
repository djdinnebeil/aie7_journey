      "response": "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, specifically through the FAFSA Simplification Act, brought significant changes to the FAFSA process, primarily focusing on streamlining and simplifying the application. The key changes include:\n\n1. Introduction of the FUTURE Act and the FA-DDX: The act authorized a direct data exchange with the IRS (the FA-DDX), replacing the previous IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT). This allows most applicants' income and tax information to be automatically imported from the IRS with their consent, reducing the need for self-reporting.\n\n2. Mandatory Consent and Approval: All applicants and contributors (parents/spouses) must provide consent and approval for the Department to retrieve and use Federal Tax Information (FTI) via the FA-DDX, ensuring privacy and compliance.\n\n3. Removal of the IRS Data Retrieval Tool: The IRS-DRT was retired after the 2023-24 application cycle, making the FA-DDX the primary method for importing tax data.\n\n4. Expanded Account Access without SSN: Individuals without a Social Security Number can now create their own StudentAid.gov accounts, facilitating broader participation.\n\n5. Adjustments to application deadlines and processing procedures, including new instructions and removal of certain COVID-19 related guidance.\n\n6. Changes in FAFSA application procedures: The renewal FAFSA functionality has been deferred, and the process for completing and submitting the FAFSA has been updated to reflect the new data exchanges and consent requirements.\n\nOverall, these changes aim to simplify the FAFSA process, improve data accuracy, reduce applicant burden, and ensure privacy and security through direct IRS data exchange.\n\nIf you need more detailed information about specific aspects of these changes, please let me know.",

        "Application and Verification Guide\nIntroduction\nThis guide is intended for college financial aid administrators and counselors who help students with the financial aid\nprocess4completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, verifying information, and making\ncorrections and other changes to the information reported on the FAFSA form.\nThroughout the Federal Student Aid Handbook, we use <college,= <school,= and <institution= interchangeably unless a\nmore specific use is given. Similarly, <student,= <applicant,= and <aid recipient= are synonyms. <Parents= in this volume\nrefers to the legal parents of dependent students, and <you= refers to the primary audience of the Handbook: financial aid\nadministrators at colleges. <We= indicates the U.S. Department of Education (the Department, ED), and <federal student\naid= and <Title IV aid= are synonymous terms for the financial aid offered by the Department.\nWe appreciate any comments that you have on the Application and Verification Guide (AVG), as well as all the volumes of\nthe FSA Handbook. We revise the text based on questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please\nreach out to us about how to improve the FSA Handbook through the <Contact Customer Support= feature in our Partner\nConnect Help Center clicking on <FSA Handbook= under the Topic section.\nFAFSA Simplification Act\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a\nsignificant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need\nanalysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the\nFAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for\nEducation (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process.\nChanges From the FUTURE Act\nThe Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data\nexchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate\ncompleting the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data\nRetrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX\neliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information\nreported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered\nverified for Title IV purposes.\nUnlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s\nspouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via\nthe FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid.\nOther Changes\nThroughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references\nhave been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year.\nWhere appropriate, links and publications associated with FSA9s Partner Connect and Knowledge Center have been\nproperly updated. We also removed references to COVID-19 guidance and waivers.\nSome sections were moved to better align topics and assist with narrative flow. Use the search feature to find sections\nthat may have been relocated. The following describes changes made in each chapter.\nChapter 1: The Application Process\nWe removed the <Returning FAFSA Filers= section as FAFSA renewal functionality has been deferred for future cycles.",
        "Deadlines\nThe application processing cycle typically lasts 21 months, with the FAFSA form opening on October 1 in the year prior to\nthe start of the award year. For the 2025-26 application cycle, the online FAFSA opened for beta testing to a limited\npopulation of applicants on October 1, with the form expected to be available to all applicants by December 1, 2024.\nApplications will be accepted through June 30, 2026.\nThe FPS must receive a student9s online FAFSA information by June 30, 2026. A paper FAFSA form must be legible, and it\nmust be mailed to the Federal Student Aid Programs address listed on the FAFSA form in time for the processor to receive\nit by June 30, 2026. There are no exceptions to these deadlines. An online application received after June 30, 2026, will\nnot be processed.\nA paper application received before the application opens for the award year, or after June 30, 2026, will be returned\nunprocessed with a letter of explanation. If it is signed before and received after the application opens for the award year,\nit will be accepted but the student will receive a rejected FAFSA Submission Summary asking them to date and re-sign the\nFAFSA Submission Summary and return it for processing.\nFor other deadlines pertaining to corrections, changes, disbursements, and verification, see the official deadline notice for\nthe 2025-26 award year. It will provide all the processing deadline dates and will be available in the Knowledge Center\nunder <Federal Registers.= For these deadlines, the date the FPS processed the ISIR transaction is the date the institution\nreceived the ISIR. The processed date is displayed above the SAI on the first page of the FAFSA Submission Summary and\nISIR printout.\nStudents who submit the FAFSA form later in the award year can receive aid for the entire year, including completed\npayment periods, if they were not ineligible at the time. See the section on retroactive disbursements for completed\nperiods in Volume 4, Chapter 2 of the FSA Handbook.\nWebsites for students\nhttps://studentaid.gov/4Higher education portal that contains resources and information about paying for\ncollege. The site includes access to the FAFSA application, loan information, counseling, repayment, and other\ntools to help future, current, and former students access financial aid.\nhttps://studentaid.gov/fafsa4Submit a FAFSA application or make corrections to a previously submitted\napplication; get an online FAFSA Submission Summary; check status of an application.\nhttps://studentaid.gov/aid-estimator/4The Federal Student Aid Estimator can help applicants understand\ntheir options to pay for college or career school by providing an early estimate of the SAI and eligibility for federal\nstudent aid.\nhttps://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch4Create an account username and password, which\nallows students, FAFSA contributors, and other borrowers access to the StudentAid.gov portal.\nhttps://studentaid.gov/fafsa-apply/parents4Who counts as a parent on the FAFSA form?

It includes the following volumes and replaces previous stand-alone\nguides:\nVolume 1 3 Summary of Changes (PDF)\nVolume 2 3 FPS Schedule and Getting Help (PDF)\nVolume 3 3 Electronic Data Exchange and FAFSA Processing (PDF)",
        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3.\nThe easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported. However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form.\nFUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form.\nConsent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper).\nTo provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department.\nFAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",
        "Chapter 1\nThe Application Process: FAFSA to ISIR\nThe laws governing the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs require that a person apply for aid with a form provided by\nthe U.S. Department of Education (ED, Department) and that no fee be charged for processing it. This form is the Free\nApplication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form.\nTo be considered for federal student aid, a student must complete a FAFSA form. It collects financial and other information\nused to calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI; formerly Expected Family Contribution or EFC) and to determine a student9s\neligibility through computer matches with other agencies.\nThe FAFSA form is the only application students must complete to apply for Title IV aid. A school cannot require extra\ninformation from students to package Title IV aid, except for verification, resolution of conflicting information, or\nprofessional judgment determinations. However, a school may require additional information for other purposes, such as\npackaging private or institutional aid. If the school collects additional information that affects Title IV eligibility, it must\ntake the information into account when awarding Title IV aid.\nTypes of FAFSA Applications\nMore than 99% of FAFSA forms are filed electronically. However, there are other options for individuals unwilling or unable\nto file electronically.\nFAFSA Online\nImplementation of the FAFSA Simplification Act and the FUTURE Act required a complete overhaul of the FAFSA form,\nbeginning with the 2024-25 award year. Submitted FAFSA forms are sent directly to the FAFSA Processing System (FPS).\nHelp is available for students online or by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-4-FED-AID\n(1-800-433-3243).\nThere are many advantages to filing electronically, including:\nFaster processing;\nAvailability of online help;\nSkip logic, which allows applicants to skip over questions that don9t pertain to them; and\nFewer errors and rejected applications because internal and end-of-entry data edits ensure that required fields are\ncompleted and conflicts are resolved prior to submission.\nPaper (PDF) FAFSA Form\nThe paper (PDF) FAFSA form is available on StudentAid.gov. In future cycles, students will also be able to call the Federal\nStudent Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-433-3243 to request a single copy.\nThe form can be printed and completed by hand, or by typing the data on the PDF before printing and mailing it. The\nmailing address is printed on the first page of the FAFSA form under <Mail Your FAFSA® Form=. The address changes\nannually, so use the address printed on the associated year9s FAFSA form.\nYou must mail all fillable pages of the form (pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to\nthe applicant. Extra postage will be required due to the size and/or weight of the mailing.\nFSA no longer prints or mails aid-related publications, though they are available on StudentAid.gov for users to download\nand print.\nIncarcerated Applicants\nIncarcerated applicants who have access to the necessary technology can complete a FAFSA form online using their\nStudentAid.gov account username and password. However, many incarcerated applicants will not be able to file",
        "Chapter 2: Filling Out the FAFSA\nWe added a section on signatures which describes the appropriate use of the signature page from the FAFSA Partner\nPortal (FPP).\nWe expanded the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)= section to include subsections on (1) nontax filers, foreign\ncountries, and international organizations and (2) fiscal year tax returns.\nWe updated the tax line number used for education credits to IRS Form 1040: line 29 + IRS Form 1040 Schedule 3:\nline 3.\nWe moved the section on foreign earned income exclusion to Chapter 5.\nWe expanded <Parent Tax Filing Status (37)= section to explain the six answer options on the FAFSA form and when\neach answer should be selected. This section also explains when an answer to this question might be conflicting\ninformation that requires resolution (comment code 303).\nChapter 3: Student Aid Index (SAI) and Pell Grant Eligibility\nEdits to this chapter include general changes and updated links, but no significant changes or reorganization.\nChapter 4: Verification, Updates, and Corrections\nWe added a note regarding the unavailability of the Verification of Identity functionality in the FPP and the flexibility\nthe Department provided around reporting timeframes.\nWe added a note to the <Using the Tax Return= section regarding the treatment negative values when calculating\nIncome Earned from Work.\nWe renamed the <Special Cases= section to <Unique Situations and Exceptions= and moved <Verification for Confined\nor Incarcerated Individuals= to a subsection under this renamed section.\nUnder <Filers of Amended Returns=, we removed the exception to not update tax information for certain amended\ntax return filers. This exception was outlined in Electronic Announcement GEN-24-29 and was limited to the 2024-25\napplication cycle.\nWe updated acceptable documentation guidance for individuals who are victims of tax-related identity theft.\nWe added subsection <Birth of a Child= under the <Updating Information= section.\nChapter 5: Special Cases\nWe moved the section on foreign earned income exclusion from Chapter 2.",
        "electronically due to limitations on access to computers and the internet. These applicants can complete a paper (PDF)\nFAFSA form designated specifically for incarcerated applicants, available on the Prison Education Programs resource page\nof the FSA Knowledge Center.\nThe mailing address for the Incarcerated Applicant FAFSA form is printed on the first page of the form under <Mail Your\nFAFSA® Form=. The address changes annually and differs from the general FAFSA form mailing address, so use the\naddress printed on the associated year9s Incarcerated Applicant FAFSA form. You must mail all fillable pages of the form\n(pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to the applicant. Extra postage will be\nrequired due to the size and/or weight of the mailing.\nFAFSA Partner Portal\nThe FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP) replaced FAA Access to CPS Online beginning with the 2024-25 award year. FSA\ndecommissioned the FAA Access site after the 2023324 application cycle closed.\nThe FAFSA Partner Portal removed the ability for a financial aid administrator (FAA) to initiate a new application on behalf\nof a student. This is due to the requirement in the FUTURE Act that all FAFSA form contributors (including students,\nspouses, and parents) must provide their consent to disclose information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\napproval to retrieve and use certain Federal Tax Information (FTI). FAAs cannot provide consent and approval on behalf of\nany other person. Therefore, you will not be able to use the FPP to start and submit a new FAFSA form on an applicant9s\nbehalf. However, you can make certain corrections or updates.\nTranslation Assistance\nThe FAFSA form is available in English and Spanish. If you need assistance completing the form in English or Spanish\ncontact the FSAIC at 1-800-433-3243. Translation assistance in additional languages is available by calling 1-833-610-\n2590 and pressing <7= to request a specific language.\nAccount Username and Password (FSA ID)\nThe account username and password, also known as the FSA ID, is used to access a person9s StudentAid.gov account. It\nserves as an electronic signature and a digital identifier to allow access to various ED systems and services for students,\nspouses of students, parents, or spouses/partners of parents. Therefore, each individual must create their own account\nand should not share their login credentials with anyone, including FAAs. Users can create an account online at\nStudentAid.gov quickly and securely. See Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-123 for additional information on\ncreating a StudentAid.gov account for individuals without a Social Security number.\nEach person who provides data in the online FAFSA form must have an account username and password to access the\nform. In the past, a Social Security number (SSN) was required to create a StudentAid.gov account. Starting with the\n2024325 award year, all individuals4even those without an SSN4can create a StudentAid.gov account. Persons with an\nSSN will still have their information verified by the Social Security Administration (SSA), while those without an SSN will\nuse the TransUnion® knowledge-based identity verification process described below.\nThe account username and password are created in real-time so that the student or other contributor can use it\nimmediately to enter the FAFSA form. Pending StudentAid.gov accounts with an SSN will be sent to the SSA to be\nmatched. Only those accounts with a successful match (<SSA Match Status= value of 4 on the Institutional Student\nNote: There will be two active portals that coincide with the two open FAFSA application cycles. The links below\nare specific to the application cycle. Be sure to use the correct portal for the applicable award year.\n2024-25 FAFSA Partner Portal - https://fafsa.partnerportal.ed.gov\n2025-26 FAFSA Partner Portal - https://fafsa.partnerportal-2526.ed.gov\nIf the Department is able to consolidate to one portal in future cycles, we will provide an updated link.",
        "however, complete verification and then make the PJ adjustment on the same transaction.\nYou do not have to verify information that you will entirely remove due to PJ. For example, if a dependent student9s\nparents have separated after completion of the FAFSA form and one parent is no longer in the family size, you may decide\nto use PJ to remove that parent9s income from the FAFSA form. You do not have to verify that parent9s income prior to\nremoving it. Also, using PJ does not require you to verify a student9s application if they were not already\nselected for verification by the Department or your school.\nFinally, a school is not permitted to make a professional judgement for a student after that student has ceased to be\neligible, including when a student is no longer enrolled.\nThe verification page on the FSA Assessments site has guidance to help you review your PJ and dependency override\nprocedures; see Activity 2.\nProfessional Judgment During a Disaster, Emergency, or Economic\nDownturn\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act codified previous guidance from the Department (as issued in earlier Dear Colleague Letters)\nto use statutory authority to exercise professional judgment during a disaster, emergency, or economic downturn.\nDuring a qualifying emergency, financial aid administrators may:\ndetermine that the income earned from work for an applicant is zero, if the applicant can provide paper or electronic\ndocumentation of receipt of unemployment benefits or confirmation that an application for unemployment benefits\nwas submitted; and\nmake additional appropriate adjustments to the income earned from work for a student, parent, or spouse, as\napplicable, based on the totality of the family's situation, including consideration of unemployment benefits.\nAcceptable documentation of unemployment should be submitted not more than 90 days from the date it was issued.\nHowever, institutions may use discretion to accept documentation older than 90 days under their general professional\njudgment authority if they do not have reason to believe there is conflicting information.\nFurther, the Department will adjust the program review selection model to account for an increase in the use of\nPJ Examples\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 1: A student9s parent had income earned from work of $50,000 in 2023 but is no\nlonger employed. After receiving documentation confirming this, the FAA at the student9s college decides to\nadjust the AGI reported on the student9s FAFSA form for the student9s parents to account for their reduced\nincome. The FAA also reduces the income earned from work for the student9s parent to zero.\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 2: In 2023, a student had $4,500 in medical expenses that were out-of-pocket costs.\nThe student is married and has two children, so their IPA is $69,670. Because the student9s expenses were less\nthan the amount for medical expenses already provided for in the IPA (11% of $69,670 is $7,664), the aid\nadministrator chose not to adjust the student9s FAFSA form.\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 3: A student9s parents were married when they completed the FAFSA form but have\nnow divorced. The parents filed their taxes jointly in 2023 but separately in 2024. The student receives more than\n50% of their financial support from their mother, even though they do not live with their mother due to college\nenrollment. The FAA at the student9s college determines that the mother9s income and asset information should\nbe reported on the FAFSA form. The FAA decides to collect the mother9s 2024 tax return, since it only contains the\nmother9s income information, and use it to update the 2025-26 FAFSA form. The FAA also updates the parent9s\nmarital status to <Divorced=, family size to reflect that the second parent is no longer in the family, and tax filing\nstatus to accurately reflect the mother9s 2024 tax return.",
        "parent spouse or partner contributor section.\nParent Spouse or Partner Identity Information (42)\nLike the student, the parent spouse or partner identity information should match what appears on their social security\ncard. If the parent spouse or partner does not have a Social Security number and is completing their section of the form\nonline, the SSN field will automatically be blank based on the information in their StudentAid.gov account. If the parent\nspouse is completing their section using the paper (PDF) FAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field. In both\napplication methods, the parent should enter their ITIN, if they have one, in the ITIN field.\nParent Spouse or Partner Contact Information (43)\nThis is the parent spouse9s or partner9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address.\nParent Spouse or Partner Tax Filing Status (44)\nThis question asks if the parent spouse or partner filed (or will file) a 2023 IRS 1040 or 1040-NR. It also asks about income\nearned in a foreign country or if the parent spouse or partner filed a tax return in a U.S. territory. See the discussion of tax\nreturn data in the <Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the\nFA-DDX or be manually entered by the parent spouse or partner.\nParent Spouse or Partner 2023 Tax Return Information (45)\nThis information comes directly from the parent spouse9s or partner9s 2023 federal tax return. See the discussion of tax\nreturn data in the <Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the\nFA-DDX or be manually entered by the parent spouse or partner. Unlike the parent, the parent spouse or partner will not\nbe asked to report either (1) taxable college grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits, or (2) receipt of the earned\nincome credit. See <Student Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28)= for further explanation of these two excluded\nelements.\nParent Spouse or Partner Consent, Approval, and Signature (46)\nEvery parent spouse or partner contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The parent spouse or partner contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information\nto the IRS.\nApproval 3 The parent spouse or partner must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may\nreceive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The parent spouse or partner contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their\nsignature on the online FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nA dependent student with (1) unmarried parents living together or (2) a married or remarried parent who did not file their\n2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete FAFSA form ready for processing. The student will\nreceive an email confirmation that their FAFSA form is complete. The parent spouse or partner will see an abbreviated\nconfirmation that the form is complete, and that the student has been notified. If the applicant provided an email address,\nthey will receive an email when the FAFSA form is processed with instructions for accessing their FAFSA Submission\nSummary. Applicants without an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nRole: Preparer\nIf someone other than the student, student spouse, parent, or parent spouse or partner completed a portion of the FAFSA\nform on the applicant9s behalf, that person must complete the Preparer section. Paid preparers are prohibited. This\nsection consists of three questions related to the unpaid preparer.",
        "does not have a Social Security number and is completing their section of the form online, the SSN field will automatically\nbe blank, based on the information in the StudentAid.gov account. If the parent is completing their section of the form\nusing the paper (PDF) FAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field. In both application methods, the parent should\nenter their ITIN, if they have one, in the ITIN field.\nParent Contact Information (31)\nThis is the parent9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address.\nParent Current Marital Status (32)\nThis is the parent9s marital status <as of today= 3 the day the application is signed. Marital status cannot be projected. It\ncan be updated in limited circumstances; see Chapter 4.\nA student9s parent in a relationship that meets the criteria for common-law marriage in their state of legal residence\nshould select <married=. If the state doesn9t consider their situation to be a common-law marriage or doesn9t recognize\ncommon-law marriage, then they aren9t married; parents would report that they are unmarried and living together. Check\nwith the appropriate state agency concerning the definition of a common-law marriage.\nParent State of Legal Residence (33)\nThis is used to determine which poverty guideline to use when evaluating eligibility for a Maximum or Minimum Pell Grant\nfor a dependent student.\nFamily Size (34)\nSee <Family Size (9)= in the student section for further explanation of family size for online filers.\nFor paper (PDF) FAFSA filers, family size appears in both the student and parent contributor sections of the form. The\ninformation reported in the parent section of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form will supersede information reported in the\nstudent section, if applicable.\nThe following persons are included in the family size of a dependent student:\nThe student\nThe parent (and their spouse or partner)\nThe parent9s dependent children, (even if they live apart from the parents due to a qualifying temporary absence\nunder IRS code, such as living apart due to college enrollment) who will receive more than half of their support from\nthe parent (and spouse or partner) from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026. Unborn children should not be included\nin the family size, though the family size can be updated if the child is born and will receive more than half of their\nsupport from the parent (and spouse or partner) during the award year.\nOther persons who live with and receive more than half their support from the parent (and spouse or partner) and\nwill receive more than half support for the entire award year.\nNumber in College (35)\nWhile number in college is no longer used to calculate a student9s SAI, the FAFSA Simplification Act requires the question\nto be included on the FAFSA form. Schools can use the information provided to perform a special circumstance adjustment\nfor a student. See <Professional Judgment= in Chapter 5: Special Cases of this volume for additional information.\nThe student is always included in the number in college. Also included are those in the family size who are or will be\nenrolled at least half time during the award year in a degree or certificate program at a Title IV-eligible school.\nFederal Benefits Received (36)\nA student may be eligible to have their and their parents9 assets excluded from the SAI calculation if they (or someone in\ntheir family) received one (or more) federal benefits during the 2023 or 2024 calendar years. See the <Federal Benefits",
        "Summary or, if the FPS has the student9s email address, an email with a link to view the student9s updated FAFSA\nSubmission Summary on the web.\nPaper FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who received a paper FAFSA Submission Summary may make\ncorrections or updates on it, then sign and return it to the FAFSA processor at the address given at the end of the FAFSA\nSubmission Summary. If a contributor9s information is updated or corrected, that contributor also must sign the FAFSA\nSubmission Summary before submitting it for processing.\nStudents who applied electronically are encouraged to return to their Dashboard on StudentAid.gov to make corrections.\nStudents who applied electronically but would like to make corrections via paper may have a paper FAFSA Submission\nSummary mailed to them by calling the FSAIC at 1-800-4-FED-AID and providing their name, SSN, and date of birth,\nthough this feature may not be available until later in the application cycle.\nAdding Schools and Changing a Student9s Address\nAs with other changes, a student can add schools or change their address, email address, or telephone number online or\non a paper FAFSA Submission Summary. A student can also update these items over the phone by calling 1-800-433-3243\nand providing their DRN, though this feature may not be available until later in the application cycle. You can submit\nthose changes for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal if your school is listed on the student9s application, or you\nhave the student9s DRN.\nThe FAFSA form has limited space for a student to list schools that will receive the application data: 10 schools can be\nlisted on the paper application; 20 schools can be listed on the online FAFSA form. If the student wants information sent to\nmore schools, the student can use any of the methods listed previously to replace some or all the original schools. If the\nstudent originally listed 20 schools on the application and then replaced two schools with two new ones, those that were\nreplaced will not receive an ISIR from this correction or any subsequent correction on which they did not appear.\nSignatures\nAny required signatures, such as those on worksheets or on copies of tax returns, must be collected at the time of\nverification4they cannot be collected after the verification deadline for that award year.\nFor verification documentation, a school may collect an electronic signature for an applicant, parent, or spouse if the\nprocess includes an assurance of the identity of the person signing. This is often accomplished with a PIN or password that\nis assigned only after the identity of the signer has been authenticated (see DOC-Q12 on the Program Integrity Questions\nand Answers 3 Verification).\nDeadlines and Failure to Submit Documentation\nYou must require students selected for verification4either by your school or the Department4to submit the\ndocumentation by the date specified by your school (for Campus-Based and Direct Loans) or the Department (for Pell).\nCampus-Based and Direct Loans\nIf a student doesn9t provide verification documentation within your school9s established, reasonable timeframe, you\ncannot:\nDisburse more FSEOG funds,\nEmploy or permit further FWS employment, or\nFailure to Submit Documentation\n34 CFR 668.60"

Additionally, it informs students about any issues or comment codes that need resolution to ensure their application is complete and accurate for processing aid.

        "The FPS also checks the application for possible inconsistencies and mistakes. For instance, if a dependent student\nreported the parents9 marital status as married but reported the family size as <2,= the edit checks would catch the\ninconsistency. Even when data is inconsistent, the FPS may be able to calculate an SAI based on assumptions. Students\nwho submit applications online will be able to correct or confirm FPS edits before submitting the application.\nOutput Documents\nAfter processing is complete, the FPS produces output documents 3 the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) and\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary 3 that show the information the student originally provided, the SAI, results of the\neligibility matches, information about aid history, and information about any inconsistencies identified through the FPS\nedits. If the FPS was unable to calculate an SAI, the output record will not show one. The ISIR is made available\nelectronically to the schools the student listed on the FAFSA form (or added later) and their state agency. The FAFSA\nSubmission Summary is made available to the student online or a paper FAFSA Submission Summary is mailed to the\nstudent if the student is unable to access it online. The type of output document depends on the type of record that the\napplicant submitted. Neither the online nor the paper FAFSA Submission Summary will contain FTI. See Volume 6 of the\n2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide for additional information.\nYou will receive an ISIR for the student only if the applicant includes your school on their FAFSA form. If your school is not\nlisted, you can request an ISIR for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal by adding your federal school code if you\nhave the applicant9s Data Release Number (DRN), which authorizes your access to the student9s application information.\nThe DRN appears on the FAFSA Submission Summary, on the FAFSA confirmation page, and in the FAFSA confirmation\nemail.\nYou are required to receive ISIRs and to accept FAFSA Submission Summaries from students, but you cannot require\nstudents to submit FAFSA Submission Summaries to receive aid. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student, your federal\nschool code must be added to their record so that an ISIR is sent to you. We recommend making corrections electronically\nvia the online FAFSA (the student) or the FAFSA Partner Portal (the school); however, students can also use a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary to make corrections. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student who provided a FAFSA Submission\nSummary, you must use the FAFSA Submission Summary to package and disburse the student aid. Again, you must also\nensure that your school code is added to the student9s FPS record (see the <How to Submit Corrections and Updates=\nsection in Chapter 4).\nThe FAFSA Submission Summaries and ISIRs include comment codes and text explaining any questionable results from\nFAFSA processing. Some comment codes also have an associated C Flag, which you must resolve before paying the\nstudent aid. If a student9s FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR contains a comment code that requires resolution, the\nunderlying issue must be resolved before any Title IV funds may be disbursed to the student. For instance, if an applicant\nhas defaulted on a federal student loan, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will note this in several places,\nincluding comments to the applicant and the NSLDS financial aid history page. In addition, if a school disburses Title IV\nfunds to a student with a comment code that requires resolution and the student withdraws before the school has\nresolved the underlying issue, any funds disbursed must be returned to ED since the funds were provided to an otherwise\nineligible student.\nFor other problems, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will show that the FAFSA form has been rejected and no SAI\nhas been calculated. The FAFSA Submission Summary will tell the applicant how to resolve the reject by correcting errors\nor providing consent and approval, signatures, or more information. A complete list of comments, C Flags, reject codes,\nand required resolutions are available in Volume 7 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide.\nA valid output document (ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary) is one on which all the information reported on a student9s\nFAFSA form is accurate and complete as of the date the application is signed.\nValid Output Document\n34 CFR 668.2(b)",

If the\nstudent originally listed 20 schools on the application and then replaced two schools with two new ones, those that were\nreplaced will not receive an ISIR from this correction or any subsequent correction on which they did not appear.\nSignatures\nAny required signatures, such as those on worksheets or on copies of tax returns, must be collected at the time of\nverification4they cannot be collected after the verification deadline for that award year.\nFor verification documentation, a school may collect an electronic signature for an applicant, parent, or spouse if the\nprocess includes an assurance of the identity of the person signing.

A pending username and password that has not been verified will still\nallow the user to access and submit the online FAFSA form and complete other limited actions on StudentAid.gov.\nHowever, the Department will not be able to retrieve federal tax data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For this\nreason, we recommend that users do not sign and submit the online FAFSA form until the account username and\npassword is verified through a match with the SSA.\nIf the SSN match is unsuccessful, the account is not considered verified, and an email is sent to notify the individual that\nthey should review the information they provided (name, date of birth, and SSN) to ensure it is accurate. If the applicant\nused an unverified account username and password to sign their FAFSA form, the applicant is also sent a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary requesting all required signatures.\nTransUnion® Knowledge-Based Identity Verification\nUsers who create a StudentAid.gov account without an SSN will be required to complete a knowledge-based identity\nverification process with TransUnion® to verify their identity and provide login credentials.

        "Chapter 1\nThe Application Process: FAFSA to ISIR\nThe laws governing the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs require that a person apply for aid with a form provided by\nthe U.S. Department of Education (ED, Department) and that no fee be charged for processing it. This form is the Free\nApplication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form.\nTo be considered for federal student aid, a student must complete a FAFSA form. It collects financial and other information\nused to calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI; formerly Expected Family Contribution or EFC) and to determine a student9s\neligibility through computer matches with other agencies.\nThe FAFSA form is the only application students must complete to apply for Title IV aid. A school cannot require extra\ninformation from students to package Title IV aid, except for verification, resolution of conflicting information, or\nprofessional judgment determinations. However, a school may require additional information for other purposes, such as\npackaging private or institutional aid. If the school collects additional information that affects Title IV eligibility, it must\ntake the information into account when awarding Title IV aid.\nTypes of FAFSA Applications\nMore than 99% of FAFSA forms are filed electronically. However, there are other options for individuals unwilling or unable\nto file electronically.\nFAFSA Online\nImplementation of the FAFSA Simplification Act and the FUTURE Act required a complete overhaul of the FAFSA form,\nbeginning with the 2024-25 award year. Submitted FAFSA forms are sent directly to the FAFSA Processing System (FPS).\nHelp is available for students online or by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-4-FED-AID\n(1-800-433-3243).\nThere are many advantages to filing electronically, including:\nFaster processing;\nAvailability of online help;\nSkip logic, which allows applicants to skip over questions that don9t pertain to them; and\nFewer errors and rejected applications because internal and end-of-entry data edits ensure that required fields are\ncompleted and conflicts are resolved prior to submission.\nPaper (PDF) FAFSA Form\nThe paper (PDF) FAFSA form is available on StudentAid.gov. In future cycles, students will also be able to call the Federal\nStudent Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-433-3243 to request a single copy.\nThe form can be printed and completed by hand, or by typing the data on the PDF before printing and mailing it. The\nmailing address is printed on the first page of the FAFSA form under <Mail Your FAFSA® Form=. The address changes\nannually, so use the address printed on the associated year9s FAFSA form.\nYou must mail all fillable pages of the form (pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to\nthe applicant. Extra postage will be required due to the size and/or weight of the mailing.\nFSA no longer prints or mails aid-related publications, though they are available on StudentAid.gov for users to download\nand print.\nIncarcerated Applicants\nIncarcerated applicants who have access to the necessary technology can complete a FAFSA form online using their\nStudentAid.gov account username and password. However, many incarcerated applicants will not be able to file",
        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3.\nThe easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported. However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form.\nFUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form.\nConsent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper).\nTo provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department.\nFAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",

Unborn children should not be included\nin the family size, though the family size can be updated if the child is born and will receive more than half of their\nsupport from the parent (and spouse or partner) during the award year.\nOther persons who live with and receive more than half their support from the parent (and spouse or partner) and\nwill receive more than half support for the entire award year.\nNumber in College (35)\nWhile number in college is no longer used to calculate a student9s SAI, the FAFSA Simplification Act requires the question\nto be included on the FAFSA form. Schools can use the information provided to perform a special circumstance adjustment\nfor a student. See <Professional Judgment= in Chapter 5: Special Cases of this volume for additional information.\nThe student is always included in the number in college. Also included are those in the family size who are or will be\nenrolled at least half time during the award year in a degree or certificate program at a Title IV-eligible school.\nFederal Benefits Received (36)\nA student may be eligible to have their and their parents9 assets excluded from the SAI calculation if they (or someone in\ntheir family) received one (or more) federal benefits during the 2023 or 2024 calendar years. See the <Federal Benefits",

Among other things, the student agrees to spend Title IV funds only\non educational expenses and affirms that they are not in default on a federal loan and do not owe a grant overpayment.\nFAFSA Submission\nStudents who do not have any other required contributors now have a complete FAFSA form. Students who complete and\nsubmit their FAFSA form online will receive an email version of their confirmation page. When the applicant9s FAFSA form\nis processed, students who provided an email address will receive an email notification of processing with instructions to\naccess their FAFSA Submission Summary.

Applicants with additional required contributors will need these individuals to contribute to\ntheir FAFSA form, as described next.\nContributor: Student Spouse\nThis section consists of five questions related to the student9s spouse. The student9s spouse is a required contributor on\nthe FAFSA form if the student is married and did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse.\nIf a married student is completing the FAFSA form online and the student9s spouse is identified as a required contributor,\nthe student will be prompted to enter their spouse9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and\nemail address) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The student spouse will be notified by email that they\nhave been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The spouse should use their own StudentAid.gov account\nusername and password to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s\nspouse is not a required contributor, the student will enter the same identifying information and email address, but the\nstudent9s spouse will not be invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their spouse complete the student spouse\ncontributor section.\nStudent Spouse Identity Information (25)\nLike the student, the student spouse identity information should match what appears on their social security card.

        "Application and Verification Guide\nIntroduction\nThis guide is intended for college financial aid administrators and counselors who help students with the financial aid\nprocess4completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, verifying information, and making\ncorrections and other changes to the information reported on the FAFSA form.\nThroughout the Federal Student Aid Handbook, we use <college,= <school,= and <institution= interchangeably unless a\nmore specific use is given. Similarly, <student,= <applicant,= and <aid recipient= are synonyms. <Parents= in this volume\nrefers to the legal parents of dependent students, and <you= refers to the primary audience of the Handbook: financial aid\nadministrators at colleges. <We= indicates the U.S. Department of Education (the Department, ED), and <federal student\naid= and <Title IV aid= are synonymous terms for the financial aid offered by the Department.\nWe appreciate any comments that you have on the Application and Verification Guide (AVG), as well as all the volumes of\nthe FSA Handbook. We revise the text based on questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please\nreach out to us about how to improve the FSA Handbook through the <Contact Customer Support= feature in our Partner\nConnect Help Center clicking on <FSA Handbook= under the Topic section.\nFAFSA Simplification Act\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a\nsignificant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need\nanalysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the\nFAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for\nEducation (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process.\nChanges From the FUTURE Act\nThe Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data\nexchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate\ncompleting the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data\nRetrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX\neliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information\nreported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered\nverified for Title IV purposes.\nUnlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s\nspouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via\nthe FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid.\nOther Changes\nThroughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references\nhave been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year.\nWhere appropriate, links and publications associated with FSA9s Partner Connect and Knowledge Center have been\nproperly updated. We also removed references to COVID-19 guidance and waivers.\nSome sections were moved to better align topics and assist with narrative flow. Use the search feature to find sections\nthat may have been relocated. The following describes changes made in each chapter.\nChapter 1: The Application Process\nWe removed the <Returning FAFSA Filers= section as FAFSA renewal functionality has been deferred for future cycles.",
        "Deadlines\nThe application processing cycle typically lasts 21 months, with the FAFSA form opening on October 1 in the year prior to\nthe start of the award year. For the 2025-26 application cycle, the online FAFSA opened for beta testing to a limited\npopulation of applicants on October 1, with the form expected to be available to all applicants by December 1, 2024.\nApplications will be accepted through June 30, 2026.\nThe FPS must receive a student9s online FAFSA information by June 30, 2026. A paper FAFSA form must be legible, and it\nmust be mailed to the Federal Student Aid Programs address listed on the FAFSA form in time for the processor to receive\nit by June 30, 2026. There are no exceptions to these deadlines. An online application received after June 30, 2026, will\nnot be processed.\nA paper application received before the application opens for the award year, or after June 30, 2026, will be returned\nunprocessed with a letter of explanation. If it is signed before and received after the application opens for the award year,\nit will be accepted but the student will receive a rejected FAFSA Submission Summary asking them to date and re-sign the\nFAFSA Submission Summary and return it for processing.\nFor other deadlines pertaining to corrections, changes, disbursements, and verification, see the official deadline notice for\nthe 2025-26 award year. It will provide all the processing deadline dates and will be available in the Knowledge Center\nunder <Federal Registers.= For these deadlines, the date the FPS processed the ISIR transaction is the date the institution\nreceived the ISIR. The processed date is displayed above the SAI on the first page of the FAFSA Submission Summary and\nISIR printout.\nStudents who submit the FAFSA form later in the award year can receive aid for the entire year, including completed\npayment periods, if they were not ineligible at the time.

        "2. The disclosure of their FTI by the IRS to the Department;\n3. The use of their FTI by a Department official to determine an applicant9s eligibility for federal student aid and the\namount for which they are eligible; and\n4. The redisclosure of FTI by the Department to an eligible institution, state higher education agency, or a designated\nscholarship organization (e.g., institutional or state financial aid).\nOnly the Department has the authority to obtain approval and consent for the use and disclosure of FTI for such purposes.\nOur partners (FAAs, advocates, etc.) are not permitted to obtain approval and consent on behalf of FAFSA contributors\n(including parent(s) or spouse) for the use and disclosure of FTI.\nOnce a FAFSA contributor has provided consent and approval for use and disclosure of FTI for a FAFSA cycle (e.g., the\n2025-26 FAFSA cycle), they cannot revoke consent for that cycle. The ability to revoke consent is not needed for FAFSA\npurposes because the FAFSA contributor is providing a one-time consent for a specific tax year and an annual consent is\nrequired for each FAFSA cycle.\nStudents and contributors are not able to view or edit the imported FTI data. This is to enhance security, privacy, and to\nreduce the risk of the misuse of sensitive data. However, you (the financial aid administrator) will be able to see the\ntransferred data on the ISIR. Schools and other partners that receive ISIRs must protect federal student aid information\nprovided to them by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the application, award, and administration of the\nfederal student aid programs as permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA, as amended. In keeping with the\nexpectation that you protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, you must not disclose FTI\nfrom the FAFSA form unless the disclosure and use is permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA 1098h. For additional\ninformation and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34.\nSignatures\nEach student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS\nand (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per\napplication cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a\nprocessed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is\naccurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction\nto contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating\nthat the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their\nFAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect\nthe necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature\nrequirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval. Only the Department can collect a contributor9s\nconsent and approval.\nFederal Tax Information\nThe following data received by the Department from the IRS are considered FTI:\nTax Year (ex. Award year 2025-26 is based on 2023 tax year information from the IRS)\nTax Filing Status\nAdjusted Gross Income (AGI)\nNumber of Exemptions and Number of Dependents\nIncome Earned from Work\nTaxes Paid\nEducational Credits\nUntaxed IRA distributions\nIRA deductions and payments\nTax exempt interest\nUntaxed pension amounts\nSchedule C net profit/loss",
        "The ISIR will only display the federal school code of the receiving school. The information of other schools the student\nincluded on the FAFSA form will not appear except on the FAFSA Submission Summary and on ISIRs sent to state grant\nagencies. See Volume 6 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specification Guide.\nStudent Consent, Approval, and Signature (24)\nEvery student must provide the following to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The student must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the IRS.\nApproval 3 The student must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may receive, use, and\nredisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The student9s FSA ID (account username and password) will serve as their signature on the online\nFAFSA form. Paper (PDF) FAFSA form filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nIn addition to certifying that the data on the FAFSA form is correct, the student is also signing a statement of educational\npurpose, which is required to receive Title IV funds. Among other things, the student agrees to spend Title IV funds only\non educational expenses and affirms that they are not in default on a federal loan and do not owe a grant overpayment.\nFAFSA Submission\nStudents who do not have any other required contributors now have a complete FAFSA form. Students who complete and\nsubmit their FAFSA form online will receive an email version of their confirmation page. When the applicant9s FAFSA form\nis processed, students who provided an email address will receive an email notification of processing with instructions to\naccess their FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their\nFAFSA Submission Summary. Applicants with additional required contributors will need these individuals to contribute to\ntheir FAFSA form, as described next.\nContributor: Student Spouse\nThis section consists of five questions related to the student9s spouse. The student9s spouse is a required contributor on\nthe FAFSA form if the student is married and did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse.\nIf a married student is completing the FAFSA form online and the student9s spouse is identified as a required contributor,\nthe student will be prompted to enter their spouse9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and\nemail address) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The student spouse will be notified by email that they\nhave been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The spouse should use their own StudentAid.gov account\nusername and password to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s\nspouse is not a required contributor, the student will enter the same identifying information and email address, but the\nstudent9s spouse will not be invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their spouse complete the student spouse\ncontributor section.\nStudent Spouse Identity Information (25)\nLike the student, the student spouse identity information should match what appears on their social security card. If the\nstudent spouse does not have a Social Security number and is completing their section of the form online, the SSN field\nwill be blank, based on their StudentAid.gov account information. If they are completing their section on the paper (PDF)\nFAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field. In both application methods, the student spouse should enter their\nITIN, if they have one, in the ITIN field.\nStudent Spouse Contact Information (26)\nThis is the student spouse9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address.\nStudent Spouse Tax Filing Status (27)",
        "Indicators for Schedules A, B, D, E, F, H\nIRS response code\nIn some limited circumstances, the student or contributor may need to manually provide data if it is unavailable through\nthe FA-DDX or does not reflect their current personal circumstances. In these cases, manually entered data will be used in\nthe SAI calculation. For example, a contributor would be required to manually report income and tax data if they were\nmarried and filed their 2023 U.S. tax return jointly with their spouse but are now divorced.\nIRS Response Codes\nThe IRS will provide one of the following response codes for each contributor, and they will appear on a student9s ISIR.\nCode\nIndication\n200\nUsable FTI data retrieved successfully\n214\nNo return on file\n203\n206\n212\nNo usable FTI data retrieved\nThe IRS provides a response code value of <200= when the IRS has data and it was successfully shared with FSA for\ninclusion on the applicant9s FAFSA form. Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler.\nIRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution.\nContributors\n<Contributor= refers to anyone who is required to provide information, consent, and approval, and a signature on the\nFAFSA form. The FAFSA form is organized by contributor. Each contributor will complete their own section of the form\nwhich contains specific questions and instructions pertaining to that contributor. The guidance in this chapter\nsupplements those instructions and explains why some of the questions are needed on the FAFSA form.\nThe following sections discuss the questions found within each contributor section on the FAFSA form. The parents\nmentioned are the legal parents of dependent students. The numbers in parentheses are for the items as they appear on\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary, ISIR, paper (PDF) FAFSA, and FAFSA Partner Portal. The FAFSA form is considered a\n<snapshot= of the family9s information as of the date the application is signed and it can be updated only in certain\ncircumstances and only for certain items. See Chapter 4 for more information about updating a FAFSA form.\nContributor: Student\nThis section consists of 24 questions related to the student.\nStudent Identity Information (1)\nThis question requests the name, date of birth, and Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification\nNumber (ITIN) of the student contributor. The name, with other identifying information, is used for several data matches.",
        "reconcile the conflicting information and take appropriate action under the specific program requirements (depending on\nthe outcome, funds may have to be returned).\nSubsequent ISIRs\nYou are generally required to review all subsequent transactions for a student for the entire processing year even if you\nverified an earlier transaction. An exception to this requirement is if a later transaction comes in after the student is no\nlonger enrolled at your institution. Review the SAI, C flag, or verification tracking group for changes. Review new\ncomments or NSLDS information that impacts eligibility for aid. Check any updates or corrections. If the SAI has not\nchanged and there are no changes in the C flag, verification tracking group, or NSLDS information, no action is generally\nrequired. If the SAI does change but it either doesn9t affect the amount and type of aid received or the data elements that\nchanged were already verified, no action is required. But if the SAI changes and the pertinent data elements were not\nverified, then you must investigate. Of course, any time the C flag changes or NSLDS data have been modified, you must\nresolve any conflicts.\nDiscrepant Tax Data\nFinancial aid administrators do not need to be tax experts, but there are some issues that even a layperson with basic tax\nlaw information can evaluate. Because conflicting data often involve such information, FAAs must have a fundamental\nunderstanding of relevant tax issues that can impact the need analysis. You are obligated to know (1) whether a person\nwas required to file a tax return and (2) what the correct filing status for a person should be. The IRS9s online Interactive\nTax Assistant can help with these and other issues by walking the user through a series of questions. IRS Publication 17 is\nalso a useful resource.\nResolution of Conflicting Information\nYou must resolve conflicting information prior to disbursing aid to a student enrolled at your school. Even if the conflict\nconcerns a previous award year, you must still investigate it. You have resolved the matter when you have\ndetermined which data are correct; this might simply be confirming that an earlier determination was the right one. You\nmust document your findings and include an explanation that justifies your decision.\nThe verification page on the FSA Assessments site has guidance to help you review your conflicting information\nprocedures; see Activity 1.\nReferral of Fraud Cases\nRequirement to Verify Questionable Data\n34 CFR 668.54(a)(2)\nDiscrepant Tax Data Example\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 7: An FAA notices that a dependent student9s parents, who are married and live\ntogether, have each filed as head of household (which offers a greater tax deduction than filing as single or\nmarried). The FAA must ask if that is the right status. Resolution of the conflict could be the parents refiling and\nsubmitting a copy of the amended return or a reasonable explanation of why there is no conflict under IRS rules.",
        "The FPS also checks the application for possible inconsistencies and mistakes. For instance, if a dependent student\nreported the parents9 marital status as married but reported the family size as <2,= the edit checks would catch the\ninconsistency. Even when data is inconsistent, the FPS may be able to calculate an SAI based on assumptions. Students\nwho submit applications online will be able to correct or confirm FPS edits before submitting the application.\nOutput Documents\nAfter processing is complete, the FPS produces output documents 3 the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) and\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary 3 that show the information the student originally provided, the SAI, results of the\neligibility matches, information about aid history, and information about any inconsistencies identified through the FPS\nedits. If the FPS was unable to calculate an SAI, the output record will not show one. The ISIR is made available\nelectronically to the schools the student listed on the FAFSA form (or added later) and their state agency. The FAFSA\nSubmission Summary is made available to the student online or a paper FAFSA Submission Summary is mailed to the\nstudent if the student is unable to access it online. The type of output document depends on the type of record that the\napplicant submitted. Neither the online nor the paper FAFSA Submission Summary will contain FTI. See Volume 6 of the\n2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide for additional information.\nYou will receive an ISIR for the student only if the applicant includes your school on their FAFSA form. If your school is not\nlisted, you can request an ISIR for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal by adding your federal school code if you\nhave the applicant9s Data Release Number (DRN), which authorizes your access to the student9s application information.\nThe DRN appears on the FAFSA Submission Summary, on the FAFSA confirmation page, and in the FAFSA confirmation\nemail.\nYou are required to receive ISIRs and to accept FAFSA Submission Summaries from students, but you cannot require\nstudents to submit FAFSA Submission Summaries to receive aid. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student, your federal\nschool code must be added to their record so that an ISIR is sent to you. We recommend making corrections electronically\nvia the online FAFSA (the student) or the FAFSA Partner Portal (the school); however, students can also use a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary to make corrections. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student who provided a FAFSA Submission\nSummary, you must use the FAFSA Submission Summary to package and disburse the student aid. Again, you must also\nensure that your school code is added to the student9s FPS record (see the <How to Submit Corrections and Updates=\nsection in Chapter 4).\nThe FAFSA Submission Summaries and ISIRs include comment codes and text explaining any questionable results from\nFAFSA processing. Some comment codes also have an associated C Flag, which you must resolve before paying the\nstudent aid. If a student9s FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR contains a comment code that requires resolution, the\nunderlying issue must be resolved before any Title IV funds may be disbursed to the student. For instance, if an applicant\nhas defaulted on a federal student loan, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will note this in several places,\nincluding comments to the applicant and the NSLDS financial aid history page. In addition, if a school disburses Title IV\nfunds to a student with a comment code that requires resolution and the student withdraws before the school has\nresolved the underlying issue, any funds disbursed must be returned to ED since the funds were provided to an otherwise\nineligible student.\nFor other problems, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will show that the FAFSA form has been rejected and no SAI\nhas been calculated. The FAFSA Submission Summary will tell the applicant how to resolve the reject by correcting errors\nor providing consent and approval, signatures, or more information. A complete list of comments, C Flags, reject codes,\nand required resolutions are available in Volume 7 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide.\nA valid output document (ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary) is one on which all the information reported on a student9s\nFAFSA form is accurate and complete as of the date the application is signed.\nValid Output Document\n34 CFR 668.2(b)",

If the parent is completing their section of the form\nusing the paper (PDF) FAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field. In both application methods, the parent should\nenter their ITIN, if they have one, in the ITIN field.\nParent Contact Information (31)\nThis is the parent9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address.\nParent Current Marital Status (32)\nThis is the parent9s marital status <as of today= 3 the day the application is signed. Marital status cannot be projected. It\ncan be updated in limited circumstances; see Chapter 4.\nA student9s parent in a relationship that meets the criteria for common-law marriage in their state of legal residence\nshould select <married=. If the state doesn9t consider their situation to be a common-law marriage or doesn9t recognize\ncommon-law marriage, then they aren9t married; parents would report that they are unmarried and living together. Check\nwith the appropriate state agency concerning the definition of a common-law marriage.\nParent State of Legal Residence (33)\nThis is used to determine which poverty guideline to use when evaluating eligibility for a Maximum or Minimum Pell Grant\nfor a dependent student.\nFamily Size (34)\nSee <Family Size (9)= in the student section for further explanation of family size for online filers.\nFor paper (PDF) FAFSA filers, family size appears in both the student and parent contributor sections of the form. The\ninformation reported in the parent section of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form will supersede information reported in the\nstudent section, if applicable.\nThe following persons are included in the family size of a dependent student:\nThe student\nThe parent (and their spouse or partner)\nThe parent9s dependent children, (even if they live apart from the parents due to a qualifying temporary absence\nunder IRS code, such as living apart due to college enrollment) who will receive more than half of their support from\nthe parent (and spouse or partner) from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026. Unborn children should not be included\nin the family size, though the family size can be updated if the child is born and will receive more than half of their\nsupport from the parent (and spouse or partner) during the award year.\nOther persons who live with and receive more than half their support from the parent (and spouse or partner) and\nwill receive more than half support for the entire award year.\nNumber in College (35)\nWhile number in college is no longer used to calculate a student9s SAI, the FAFSA Simplification Act requires the question\nto be included on the FAFSA form. Schools can use the information provided to perform a special circumstance adjustment\nfor a student. See <Professional Judgment= in Chapter 5: Special Cases of this volume for additional information.\nThe student is always included in the number in college. Also included are those in the family size who are or will be\nenrolled at least half time during the award year in a degree or certificate program at a Title IV-eligible school.\nFederal Benefits Received (36)\nA student may be eligible to have their and their parents9 assets excluded from the SAI calculation if they (or someone in\ntheir family) received one (or more) federal benefits during the 2023 or 2024 calendar years.

A pending username and password that has not been verified will still\nallow the user to access and submit the online FAFSA form and complete other limited actions on StudentAid.gov.\nHowever, the Department will not be able to retrieve federal tax data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For this\nreason, we recommend that users do not sign and submit the online FAFSA form until the account username and\npassword is verified through a match with the SSA.\nIf the SSN match is unsuccessful, the account is not considered verified, and an email is sent to notify the individual that\nthey should review the information they provided (name, date of birth, and SSN) to ensure it is accurate. If the applicant\nused an unverified account username and password to sign their FAFSA form, the applicant is also sent a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary requesting all required signatures.\nTransUnion® Knowledge-Based Identity Verification\nUsers who create a StudentAid.gov account without an SSN will be required to complete a knowledge-based identity\nverification process with TransUnion® to verify their identity and provide login credentials. The student (if a citizen of one\nof the Freely Associated States - the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, or the Federated States of\nMicronesia), student9s spouse, parent, or parent spouse/partner are sent through the TransUnion® process when they do\nnot have an SSN and check the <I don9t have an SSN= box during the account creation process. They will be asked to\nprovide additional information to confirm their identity.\nFAFSA Filers Under the Age of 13\nBecause the Children9s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 prohibits any entity, including a government\nagency, from electronically conducting business or communicating with a person under age 13, applicants who are 12 or\nyounger cannot complete the FAFSA form online. Instead, when they apply for financial aid, the student and required\ncontributor(s) can fill out the appropriate award year paper (PDF) FAFSA form and mail it to:\nFederal Student Aid Programs\nAttn: COPPA Process\n25 Air Park Drive\nLondon, KY 40744-8236\nSuch applicants should not provide an email address on the application or any correction that might follow. After the\nFAFSA form is submitted, it will be processed and a paper FAFSA Submission Summary will be sent to the student and an\nISIR will be sent to schools.

        "guidance on returning aid in such situations in Volume 4, Chapter 3 of the FSA Handbook.\nAfter Documentation Is Complete\nWhen you have obtained all necessary verification documents from the student, you should compare them to the FAFSA\nSubmission Summary or ISIR you are reviewing for payment. If all the student9s information is correct or has been\ncorrected and there are no outstanding issues or unresolved conflicting information, you may award and disburse aid for\nwhich the student is eligible.\nSometimes schools ask if even further verification is needed to resolve discrepancies between the ISIR and what the\nstudent provided for verification. The answer is no unless you have reason to doubt the accuracy of the verification\ninformation. Acceptable documentation either confirms that an item was right on the ISIR, or it is used to correct that\nitem. That is the purpose of verification; continued fact-finding is not necessary.\nHow to Submit Corrections and Updates\nCorrections and updates can be submitted by the student on the FAFSA Submission Summary or the web or by the school\nusing the FAFSA Partner Portal or the Electronic Data Exchange (EDE). In addition to the following information, see also\nVolume 3 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide.\nOnline FAFSA Form. Students and other contributors can correct previously submitted data that was not imported from\nthe IRS.\nFAFSA Partner Portal or EDE. An FAA can submit corrections to a student9s application data using the FAFSA Partner\nPortal. Your school can submit corrections and updates electronically by entering the data manually in the FAFSA Partner\nPortal or by transmitting it to the FAFSA Processing System. However, you cannot update an applicant9s or contributor9s\npersonally identifiable information (PII) or consent and approval using EDE, a third-party software, or the FAFSA Partner\nPortal.\nIf your school isn9t listed on the transaction you want to correct, the student must provide you with the DRN printed on the\nFAFSA Submission Summary. You can then add your school in the next available institution field and gain electronic\naccess to the resulting corrected transaction. If all the fields are filled, the student must add your school code using the\nFAFSA online.\nCorrections and updates sent by a school must be based on reliable documentation in its possession that supports the\nchanges to applicant data or signed documentation from the student or contributor. Examples of reliable documentation\ninclude applications for admission, acceptance letters, course registration information, or academic transcripts. Examples\nof signed documentation from a student or contributor on which corrections and updates may be based include a FAFSA\nSubmission Summary, a copy of the correction or update, student/contributor statement, verification documents, or\ncopies of tax returns or transcripts. These do not have to be wet signatures.\nThe FPS will process the change, send an ISIR to the school, and send the student an updated FAFSA Submission\nNote: Batch corrections and updates may not be available at the time you need to begin making such corrections\nor updates. However, these instructions are provided for future use when this functionality becomes available.\nNote: Some student-initiated corrections have been flagged incorrectly as school-initiated corrections on the\nresulting ISIR transaction. The Department is aware of this defect and working to find a resolution. If your school is\naware of a transaction that is flagged incorrectly as a school-initiated correction, you should notate the student9s\nfile. You are not required to collect documentation unless you have conflicting information or reason to believe the\ninformation on the ISIR transaction is incorrect.",
        "entity confirming to the school that the individual who completed the FAFSA form and was selected for verification is the\nperson signing the Statement of Educational Purpose.\nImmigrants and Tax Filing\nImmigrants are not exempt from tax filing. The IRS is more concerned whether a person is a resident or nonresident\nrather than a legal or illegal alien. An alien is anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or national. A resident alien is one who\neither is a permanent resident or has resided in the U.S. for a specific minimum amount of time (has met the substantial\npresence test). All others are nonresident aliens. Resident aliens9 income is generally subject to tax in the same manner\nas U.S. citizens9, and they file Form 1040. Nonresident aliens who are required to file a return submit Form 1040NR, which\nis acceptable documentation for verification.\nImmigrants who do not have an SSN and are unable to get one can apply with the IRS for an individual taxpayer\nidentification number (ITIN). The ITIN is only for tax purposes. It does not authorize a person to work, endorse his or her\nlegal status, or entitle them to the earned income credit or Social Security benefits.\nSee the IRS9s Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens at www.irs.gov for more information.\nInterim Disbursements\nInterim disbursements are allowed either prior to completing verification or after verification but before receiving the\ncorrected FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR. If you have no reason to question the accuracy of the information on the\nFAFSA form, prior to completing verification you may at your discretion:\nMake one disbursement of Pell and FSEOG funds for the applicant9s first payment period;\nPermit FWS employment for the first 60 consecutive days after the student enrolls for the award year; or\nOriginate but not disburse a Direct Subsidized Loan.\nIf verification results in changes to the FAFSA information that you determine will not alter award amounts, you may at\nyour discretion also disburse a Direct Subsidized Loan prior to receiving the corrected valid FAFSA Submission Summary\nor ISIR (defined as a FAFSA Submission summary or ISIR on which all the information reported on a student9s FAFSA form\nis accurate and complete as of the date the application is signed).\nOverpayments From Interim Disbursements\nIf you make an interim disbursement of Pell or FSEOG funds prior to verification and the student9s eligibility for Title IV\nfunds changes after you complete verification, your school is liable for any resulting overpayment. If you can9t eliminate it\nby reducing subsequent disbursements or having the student return the money, your school must use its own funds to\nVerification for Confined or Incarcerated Individuals\n34 CFR Part 668 Subpart P\nDear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10\nInterim Disbursements\n34 CFR 668.58",

For example, if IRS Form 1040,\nline 1z is $50,000 and Schedule 1, line 3 is -$10,000, the income earned from work value should be $50,000.\nUsing the Tax Transcript\nIf applicants or contributors are unable to transfer data via the FA-DDX, the student, spouse, and/or parents, as\napplicable, can use an IRS tax return transcript to document information from the tax return. Before requesting a\ntranscript, they should allow enough time to pass after filing the return; it takes the IRS two to four weeks to process\nreturns filed electronically and six to eight weeks for mailed returns. Tax transcripts submitted to your school for\nverification do not need to be signed by the tax filer (but it is encouraged) unless you have reason to doubt their\nauthenticity.\nThere are a few ways to request a tax return transcript. The IRS provides instructions on all options at\nwww.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript. Per the IRS, the fastest and easiest way is to access personal tax records online,\nwhich allows the tax filer to get a real-time, electronic transcript. Tax filers who opt to request transcripts by mail or\nphone will receive a mailed transcript in return. Schools can accept and copy transcripts originally obtained from the IRS.\nThe IRS9s Income Verification Express Service (IVES) allows a third party to request and receive a tax filer9s transcript. The\nIVES participant submits a 4506-C form, signed by the tax filer, and receives the transcript from the IRS, which charges a\nsmall fee for the service. Schools may apply to participate in IVES. They may also use a transcript from another IVES\nparticipant (which is not considered a third-party servicer in this case) for verification if they have no reason to doubt its\nauthenticity. Schools may not pass on the charge for using this service to the student.\nTo combat identity theft, the IRS masks much of the personally identifiable information on the transcript. For example,\nonly the last four digits of any SSN or account or telephone number are displayed. When requesting a transcript,\ntaxpayers will be prompted to create a <customer file number= which appears on a requested transcript to help facilitate\nidentification. This can be something like a student9s college ID number or some other number (but not an SSN). See the\nOctober 4, 2018, announcement and the IRS news release for more information.\nEach year the Department provides a tax return transcript matrix to assist schools with reviewing tax data. Specifically,\nthe tax return transcript matrix consists of a chart of the FAFSA and ISIR tax items used for verification and their\ncorresponding line items from the various IRS tax returns and the tax transcript for the appropriate award year. At the\ntime the 2025-26 Application and Verification Guide was published, the 2023 tax return transcript matrix had not been"
