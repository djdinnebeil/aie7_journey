      "response": "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, through the FAFSA Simplification Act, brought significant changes to the FAFSA process, primarily focusing on streamlining and simplifying application procedures. The key changes include:\n\n1. **Introduction of the FAFSA Simplification Act**: Mandated a comprehensive overhaul of the FAFSA form, need analysis, and related policies, in conjunction with the FUTURE Act.\n\n2. **Implementation of the Future Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)**: Replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) with a secure, near-real-time data exchange system that automatically imports certain federal tax information (FTI) directly from the IRS into the FAFSA after obtaining applicant consent. This reduces the need for self-reporting income and tax data, enhances accuracy, and considers transferred FTI as verified for Title IV purposes.\n\n3. **Enhanced Consent and Approval Requirements**: Applicants and contributors (parents/spouses) must explicitly provide consent and approval for the Department of Education to retrieve and use IRS data via the FA-DDX. Signatures are now required, and consent patches the process for both online and paper applications.\n\n4. **Changes in Application Process and User Interface**:\n   - The FAFSA form was updated to include new instructions, and some sections (like the Returning FAFSA Filers) were deferred.\n   - Both online and paper FAFSA forms are available, with online filing offering improved skip logic and error reduction.\n   - The FAFSA Partner Portal replaced FAA Access to CPS Online, limiting certain administrative functions like initiating a new application on behalf of a student, emphasizing that all contributors must provide their own consent.\n\n5. **Updated Deadlines and Processing**:\n   - The application cycle for 2025-26 opened for beta testing on October 1, 2024, with full availability expected by December 1, 2024.\n   - Applications are accepted through June 30, 2026.\n   - Deadlines for submitting and correcting applications, as well as for verification and disbursement processes, were clarified.\n\n6. **Reduction of Certain Features**:\n   - FAFSA renewal functionality has been deferred to future cycles.\n   - Certain COVID-19 related guidance and waivers were removed to reflect updated policies.\n\nOverall, these changes aim to make the FAFSA process more user-friendly, reduce the burden of income reporting, enhance data accuracy, and improve the efficiency and security of federal student aid administration.",

        "Application and Verification Guide\nIntroduction\nThis guide is intended for college financial aid administrators and counselors who help students with the financial aid\nprocess4completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, verifying information, and making\ncorrections and other changes to the information reported on the FAFSA form.\nThroughout the Federal Student Aid Handbook, we use <college,= <school,= and <institution= interchangeably unless a\nmore specific use is given. Similarly, <student,= <applicant,= and <aid recipient= are synonyms. <Parents= in this volume\nrefers to the legal parents of dependent students, and <you= refers to the primary audience of the Handbook: financial aid\nadministrators at colleges. <We= indicates the U.S. Department of Education (the Department, ED), and <federal student\naid= and <Title IV aid= are synonymous terms for the financial aid offered by the Department.\nWe appreciate any comments that you have on the Application and Verification Guide (AVG), as well as all the volumes of\nthe FSA Handbook. We revise the text based on questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please\nreach out to us about how to improve the FSA Handbook through the <Contact Customer Support= feature in our Partner\nConnect Help Center clicking on <FSA Handbook= under the Topic section.\nFAFSA Simplification Act\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a\nsignificant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need\nanalysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the\nFAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for\nEducation (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process.\nChanges From the FUTURE Act\nThe Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data\nexchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate\ncompleting the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data\nRetrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX\neliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information\nreported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered\nverified for Title IV purposes.\nUnlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s\nspouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via\nthe FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid.\nOther Changes\nThroughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references\nhave been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year.\nWhere appropriate, links and publications associated with FSA9s Partner Connect and Knowledge Center have been\nproperly updated. We also removed references to COVID-19 guidance and waivers.\nSome sections were moved to better align topics and assist with narrative flow. Use the search feature to find sections\nthat may have been relocated. The following describes changes made in each chapter.\nChapter 1: The Application Process\nWe removed the <Returning FAFSA Filers= section as FAFSA renewal functionality has been deferred for future cycles.",
        "Deadlines\nThe application processing cycle typically lasts 21 months, with the FAFSA form opening on October 1 in the year prior to\nthe start of the award year. For the 2025-26 application cycle, the online FAFSA opened for beta testing to a limited\npopulation of applicants on October 1, with the form expected to be available to all applicants by December 1, 2024.\nApplications will be accepted through June 30, 2026.\nThe FPS must receive a student9s online FAFSA information by June 30, 2026. A paper FAFSA form must be legible, and it\nmust be mailed to the Federal Student Aid Programs address listed on the FAFSA form in time for the processor to receive\nit by June 30, 2026. There are no exceptions to these deadlines. An online application received after June 30, 2026, will\nnot be processed.\nA paper application received before the application opens for the award year, or after June 30, 2026, will be returned\nunprocessed with a letter of explanation. If it is signed before and received after the application opens for the award year,\nit will be accepted but the student will receive a rejected FAFSA Submission Summary asking them to date and re-sign the\nFAFSA Submission Summary and return it for processing.\nFor other deadlines pertaining to corrections, changes, disbursements, and verification, see the official deadline notice for\nthe 2025-26 award year. It will provide all the processing deadline dates and will be available in the Knowledge Center\nunder <Federal Registers.= For these deadlines, the date the FPS processed the ISIR transaction is the date the institution\nreceived the ISIR. The processed date is displayed above the SAI on the first page of the FAFSA Submission Summary and\nISIR printout.\nStudents who submit the FAFSA form later in the award year can receive aid for the entire year, including completed\npayment periods, if they were not ineligible at the time. See the section on retroactive disbursements for completed\nperiods in Volume 4, Chapter 2 of the FSA Handbook.\nWebsites for students\nhttps://studentaid.gov/4Higher education portal that contains resources and information about paying for\ncollege. The site includes access to the FAFSA application, loan information, counseling, repayment, and other\ntools to help future, current, and former students access financial aid.\nhttps://studentaid.gov/fafsa4Submit a FAFSA application or make corrections to a previously submitted\napplication; get an online FAFSA Submission Summary; check status of an application.\nhttps://studentaid.gov/aid-estimator/4The Federal Student Aid Estimator can help applicants understand\ntheir options to pay for college or career school by providing an early estimate of the SAI and eligibility for federal\nstudent aid.\nhttps://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch4Create an account username and password, which\nallows students, FAFSA contributors, and other borrowers access to the StudentAid.gov portal.\nhttps://studentaid.gov/fafsa-apply/parents4Who counts as a parent on the FAFSA form? This tool helps\ndetermine which parent(s) should participate in a student9s FAFSA form.\nResources for schools\n2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide 3 This guide consolidates all FAFSA-related processing information and\nguidance into a multi-volume resource. It includes the following volumes and replaces previous stand-alone\nguides:\nVolume 1 3 Summary of Changes (PDF)\nVolume 2 3 FPS Schedule and Getting Help (PDF)\nVolume 3 3 Electronic Data Exchange and FAFSA Processing (PDF)",
        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3.\nThe easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported. However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form.\nFUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form.\nConsent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper).\nTo provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department.\nFAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",
        "Chapter 1\nThe Application Process: FAFSA to ISIR\nThe laws governing the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs require that a person apply for aid with a form provided by\nthe U.S. Department of Education (ED, Department) and that no fee be charged for processing it. This form is the Free\nApplication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form.\nTo be considered for federal student aid, a student must complete a FAFSA form. It collects financial and other information\nused to calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI; formerly Expected Family Contribution or EFC) and to determine a student9s\neligibility through computer matches with other agencies.\nThe FAFSA form is the only application students must complete to apply for Title IV aid. A school cannot require extra\ninformation from students to package Title IV aid, except for verification, resolution of conflicting information, or\nprofessional judgment determinations. However, a school may require additional information for other purposes, such as\npackaging private or institutional aid. If the school collects additional information that affects Title IV eligibility, it must\ntake the information into account when awarding Title IV aid.\nTypes of FAFSA Applications\nMore than 99% of FAFSA forms are filed electronically. However, there are other options for individuals unwilling or unable\nto file electronically.\nFAFSA Online\nImplementation of the FAFSA Simplification Act and the FUTURE Act required a complete overhaul of the FAFSA form,\nbeginning with the 2024-25 award year. Submitted FAFSA forms are sent directly to the FAFSA Processing System (FPS).\nHelp is available for students online or by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-4-FED-AID\n(1-800-433-3243).\nThere are many advantages to filing electronically, including:\nFaster processing;\nAvailability of online help;\nSkip logic, which allows applicants to skip over questions that don9t pertain to them; and\nFewer errors and rejected applications because internal and end-of-entry data edits ensure that required fields are\ncompleted and conflicts are resolved prior to submission.\nPaper (PDF) FAFSA Form\nThe paper (PDF) FAFSA form is available on StudentAid.gov. In future cycles, students will also be able to call the Federal\nStudent Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-433-3243 to request a single copy.\nThe form can be printed and completed by hand, or by typing the data on the PDF before printing and mailing it. The\nmailing address is printed on the first page of the FAFSA form under <Mail Your FAFSA® Form=. The address changes\nannually, so use the address printed on the associated year9s FAFSA form.\nYou must mail all fillable pages of the form (pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to\nthe applicant. Extra postage will be required due to the size and/or weight of the mailing.\nFSA no longer prints or mails aid-related publications, though they are available on StudentAid.gov for users to download\nand print.\nIncarcerated Applicants\nIncarcerated applicants who have access to the necessary technology can complete a FAFSA form online using their\nStudentAid.gov account username and password. However, many incarcerated applicants will not be able to file",
        "Chapter 2: Filling Out the FAFSA\nWe added a section on signatures which describes the appropriate use of the signature page from the FAFSA Partner\nPortal (FPP).\nWe expanded the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)= section to include subsections on (1) nontax filers, foreign\ncountries, and international organizations and (2) fiscal year tax returns.\nWe updated the tax line number used for education credits to IRS Form 1040: line 29 + IRS Form 1040 Schedule 3:\nline 3.\nWe moved the section on foreign earned income exclusion to Chapter 5.\nWe expanded <Parent Tax Filing Status (37)= section to explain the six answer options on the FAFSA form and when\neach answer should be selected. This section also explains when an answer to this question might be conflicting\ninformation that requires resolution (comment code 303).\nChapter 3: Student Aid Index (SAI) and Pell Grant Eligibility\nEdits to this chapter include general changes and updated links, but no significant changes or reorganization.\nChapter 4: Verification, Updates, and Corrections\nWe added a note regarding the unavailability of the Verification of Identity functionality in the FPP and the flexibility\nthe Department provided around reporting timeframes.\nWe added a note to the <Using the Tax Return= section regarding the treatment negative values when calculating\nIncome Earned from Work.\nWe renamed the <Special Cases= section to <Unique Situations and Exceptions= and moved <Verification for Confined\nor Incarcerated Individuals= to a subsection under this renamed section.\nUnder <Filers of Amended Returns=, we removed the exception to not update tax information for certain amended\ntax return filers. This exception was outlined in Electronic Announcement GEN-24-29 and was limited to the 2024-25\napplication cycle.\nWe updated acceptable documentation guidance for individuals who are victims of tax-related identity theft.\nWe added subsection <Birth of a Child= under the <Updating Information= section.\nChapter 5: Special Cases\nWe moved the section on foreign earned income exclusion from Chapter 2.",
        "Summary or, if the FPS has the student9s email address, an email with a link to view the student9s updated FAFSA\nSubmission Summary on the web.\nPaper FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who received a paper FAFSA Submission Summary may make\ncorrections or updates on it, then sign and return it to the FAFSA processor at the address given at the end of the FAFSA\nSubmission Summary. If a contributor9s information is updated or corrected, that contributor also must sign the FAFSA\nSubmission Summary before submitting it for processing.\nStudents who applied electronically are encouraged to return to their Dashboard on StudentAid.gov to make corrections.\nStudents who applied electronically but would like to make corrections via paper may have a paper FAFSA Submission\nSummary mailed to them by calling the FSAIC at 1-800-4-FED-AID and providing their name, SSN, and date of birth,\nthough this feature may not be available until later in the application cycle.\nAdding Schools and Changing a Student9s Address\nAs with other changes, a student can add schools or change their address, email address, or telephone number online or\non a paper FAFSA Submission Summary. A student can also update these items over the phone by calling 1-800-433-3243\nand providing their DRN, though this feature may not be available until later in the application cycle. You can submit\nthose changes for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal if your school is listed on the student9s application, or you\nhave the student9s DRN.\nThe FAFSA form has limited space for a student to list schools that will receive the application data: 10 schools can be\nlisted on the paper application; 20 schools can be listed on the online FAFSA form. If the student wants information sent to\nmore schools, the student can use any of the methods listed previously to replace some or all the original schools. If the\nstudent originally listed 20 schools on the application and then replaced two schools with two new ones, those that were\nreplaced will not receive an ISIR from this correction or any subsequent correction on which they did not appear.\nSignatures\nAny required signatures, such as those on worksheets or on copies of tax returns, must be collected at the time of\nverification4they cannot be collected after the verification deadline for that award year.\nFor verification documentation, a school may collect an electronic signature for an applicant, parent, or spouse if the\nprocess includes an assurance of the identity of the person signing. This is often accomplished with a PIN or password that\nis assigned only after the identity of the signer has been authenticated (see DOC-Q12 on the Program Integrity Questions\nand Answers 3 Verification).\nDeadlines and Failure to Submit Documentation\nYou must require students selected for verification4either by your school or the Department4to submit the\ndocumentation by the date specified by your school (for Campus-Based and Direct Loans) or the Department (for Pell).\nCampus-Based and Direct Loans\nIf a student doesn9t provide verification documentation within your school9s established, reasonable timeframe, you\ncannot:\nDisburse more FSEOG funds,\nEmploy or permit further FWS employment, or\nFailure to Submit Documentation\n34 CFR 668.60",
        "however, complete verification and then make the PJ adjustment on the same transaction.\nYou do not have to verify information that you will entirely remove due to PJ. For example, if a dependent student9s\nparents have separated after completion of the FAFSA form and one parent is no longer in the family size, you may decide\nto use PJ to remove that parent9s income from the FAFSA form. You do not have to verify that parent9s income prior to\nremoving it. Also, using PJ does not require you to verify a student9s application if they were not already\nselected for verification by the Department or your school.\nFinally, a school is not permitted to make a professional judgement for a student after that student has ceased to be\neligible, including when a student is no longer enrolled.\nThe verification page on the FSA Assessments site has guidance to help you review your PJ and dependency override\nprocedures; see Activity 2.\nProfessional Judgment During a Disaster, Emergency, or Economic\nDownturn\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act codified previous guidance from the Department (as issued in earlier Dear Colleague Letters)\nto use statutory authority to exercise professional judgment during a disaster, emergency, or economic downturn.\nDuring a qualifying emergency, financial aid administrators may:\ndetermine that the income earned from work for an applicant is zero, if the applicant can provide paper or electronic\ndocumentation of receipt of unemployment benefits or confirmation that an application for unemployment benefits\nwas submitted; and\nmake additional appropriate adjustments to the income earned from work for a student, parent, or spouse, as\napplicable, based on the totality of the family's situation, including consideration of unemployment benefits.\nAcceptable documentation of unemployment should be submitted not more than 90 days from the date it was issued.\nHowever, institutions may use discretion to accept documentation older than 90 days under their general professional\njudgment authority if they do not have reason to believe there is conflicting information.\nFurther, the Department will adjust the program review selection model to account for an increase in the use of\nPJ Examples\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 1: A student9s parent had income earned from work of $50,000 in 2023 but is no\nlonger employed. After receiving documentation confirming this, the FAA at the student9s college decides to\nadjust the AGI reported on the student9s FAFSA form for the student9s parents to account for their reduced\nincome. The FAA also reduces the income earned from work for the student9s parent to zero.\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 2: In 2023, a student had $4,500 in medical expenses that were out-of-pocket costs.\nThe student is married and has two children, so their IPA is $69,670. Because the student9s expenses were less\nthan the amount for medical expenses already provided for in the IPA (11% of $69,670 is $7,664), the aid\nadministrator chose not to adjust the student9s FAFSA form.\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 3: A student9s parents were married when they completed the FAFSA form but have\nnow divorced. The parents filed their taxes jointly in 2023 but separately in 2024. The student receives more than\n50% of their financial support from their mother, even though they do not live with their mother due to college\nenrollment. The FAA at the student9s college determines that the mother9s income and asset information should\nbe reported on the FAFSA form. The FAA decides to collect the mother9s 2024 tax return, since it only contains the\nmother9s income information, and use it to update the 2025-26 FAFSA form. The FAA also updates the parent9s\nmarital status to <Divorced=, family size to reflect that the second parent is no longer in the family, and tax filing\nstatus to accurately reflect the mother9s 2024 tax return.",
        "parent spouse or partner contributor section.\nParent Spouse or Partner Identity Information (42)\nLike the student, the parent spouse or partner identity information should match what appears on their social security\ncard. If the parent spouse or partner does not have a Social Security number and is completing their section of the form\nonline, the SSN field will automatically be blank based on the information in their StudentAid.gov account. If the parent\nspouse is completing their section using the paper (PDF) FAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field. In both\napplication methods, the parent should enter their ITIN, if they have one, in the ITIN field.\nParent Spouse or Partner Contact Information (43)\nThis is the parent spouse9s or partner9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address.\nParent Spouse or Partner Tax Filing Status (44)\nThis question asks if the parent spouse or partner filed (or will file) a 2023 IRS 1040 or 1040-NR. It also asks about income\nearned in a foreign country or if the parent spouse or partner filed a tax return in a U.S. territory. See the discussion of tax\nreturn data in the <Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the\nFA-DDX or be manually entered by the parent spouse or partner.\nParent Spouse or Partner 2023 Tax Return Information (45)\nThis information comes directly from the parent spouse9s or partner9s 2023 federal tax return. See the discussion of tax\nreturn data in the <Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the\nFA-DDX or be manually entered by the parent spouse or partner. Unlike the parent, the parent spouse or partner will not\nbe asked to report either (1) taxable college grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits, or (2) receipt of the earned\nincome credit. See <Student Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28)= for further explanation of these two excluded\nelements.\nParent Spouse or Partner Consent, Approval, and Signature (46)\nEvery parent spouse or partner contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The parent spouse or partner contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information\nto the IRS.\nApproval 3 The parent spouse or partner must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may\nreceive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The parent spouse or partner contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their\nsignature on the online FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nA dependent student with (1) unmarried parents living together or (2) a married or remarried parent who did not file their\n2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete FAFSA form ready for processing. The student will\nreceive an email confirmation that their FAFSA form is complete. The parent spouse or partner will see an abbreviated\nconfirmation that the form is complete, and that the student has been notified. If the applicant provided an email address,\nthey will receive an email when the FAFSA form is processed with instructions for accessing their FAFSA Submission\nSummary. Applicants without an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nRole: Preparer\nIf someone other than the student, student spouse, parent, or parent spouse or partner completed a portion of the FAFSA\nform on the applicant9s behalf, that person must complete the Preparer section. Paid preparers are prohibited. This\nsection consists of three questions related to the unpaid preparer.",
        "electronically due to limitations on access to computers and the internet. These applicants can complete a paper (PDF)\nFAFSA form designated specifically for incarcerated applicants, available on the Prison Education Programs resource page\nof the FSA Knowledge Center.\nThe mailing address for the Incarcerated Applicant FAFSA form is printed on the first page of the form under <Mail Your\nFAFSA® Form=. The address changes annually and differs from the general FAFSA form mailing address, so use the\naddress printed on the associated year9s Incarcerated Applicant FAFSA form. You must mail all fillable pages of the form\n(pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to the applicant. Extra postage will be\nrequired due to the size and/or weight of the mailing.\nFAFSA Partner Portal\nThe FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP) replaced FAA Access to CPS Online beginning with the 2024-25 award year. FSA\ndecommissioned the FAA Access site after the 2023324 application cycle closed.\nThe FAFSA Partner Portal removed the ability for a financial aid administrator (FAA) to initiate a new application on behalf\nof a student. This is due to the requirement in the FUTURE Act that all FAFSA form contributors (including students,\nspouses, and parents) must provide their consent to disclose information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\napproval to retrieve and use certain Federal Tax Information (FTI). FAAs cannot provide consent and approval on behalf of\nany other person. Therefore, you will not be able to use the FPP to start and submit a new FAFSA form on an applicant9s\nbehalf. However, you can make certain corrections or updates.\nTranslation Assistance\nThe FAFSA form is available in English and Spanish. If you need assistance completing the form in English or Spanish\ncontact the FSAIC at 1-800-433-3243. Translation assistance in additional languages is available by calling 1-833-610-\n2590 and pressing <7= to request a specific language.\nAccount Username and Password (FSA ID)\nThe account username and password, also known as the FSA ID, is used to access a person9s StudentAid.gov account. It\nserves as an electronic signature and a digital identifier to allow access to various ED systems and services for students,\nspouses of students, parents, or spouses/partners of parents. Therefore, each individual must create their own account\nand should not share their login credentials with anyone, including FAAs. Users can create an account online at\nStudentAid.gov quickly and securely. See Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-123 for additional information on\ncreating a StudentAid.gov account for individuals without a Social Security number.\nEach person who provides data in the online FAFSA form must have an account username and password to access the\nform. In the past, a Social Security number (SSN) was required to create a StudentAid.gov account. Starting with the\n2024325 award year, all individuals4even those without an SSN4can create a StudentAid.gov account. Persons with an\nSSN will still have their information verified by the Social Security Administration (SSA), while those without an SSN will\nuse the TransUnion® knowledge-based identity verification process described below.\nThe account username and password are created in real-time so that the student or other contributor can use it\nimmediately to enter the FAFSA form. Pending StudentAid.gov accounts with an SSN will be sent to the SSA to be\nmatched. Only those accounts with a successful match (<SSA Match Status= value of 4 on the Institutional Student\nNote: There will be two active portals that coincide with the two open FAFSA application cycles. The links below\nare specific to the application cycle. Be sure to use the correct portal for the applicable award year.\n2024-25 FAFSA Partner Portal - https://fafsa.partnerportal.ed.gov\n2025-26 FAFSA Partner Portal - https://fafsa.partnerportal-2526.ed.gov\nIf the Department is able to consolidate to one portal in future cycles, we will provide an updated link.",
        "Information Record) will be considered verified. A pending username and password that has not been verified will still\nallow the user to access and submit the online FAFSA form and complete other limited actions on StudentAid.gov.\nHowever, the Department will not be able to retrieve federal tax data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For this\nreason, we recommend that users do not sign and submit the online FAFSA form until the account username and\npassword is verified through a match with the SSA.\nIf the SSN match is unsuccessful, the account is not considered verified, and an email is sent to notify the individual that\nthey should review the information they provided (name, date of birth, and SSN) to ensure it is accurate. If the applicant\nused an unverified account username and password to sign their FAFSA form, the applicant is also sent a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary requesting all required signatures.\nTransUnion® Knowledge-Based Identity Verification\nUsers who create a StudentAid.gov account without an SSN will be required to complete a knowledge-based identity\nverification process with TransUnion® to verify their identity and provide login credentials. The student (if a citizen of one\nof the Freely Associated States - the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, or the Federated States of\nMicronesia), student9s spouse, parent, or parent spouse/partner are sent through the TransUnion® process when they do\nnot have an SSN and check the <I don9t have an SSN= box during the account creation process. They will be asked to\nprovide additional information to confirm their identity.\nFAFSA Filers Under the Age of 13\nBecause the Children9s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 prohibits any entity, including a government\nagency, from electronically conducting business or communicating with a person under age 13, applicants who are 12 or\nyounger cannot complete the FAFSA form online. Instead, when they apply for financial aid, the student and required\ncontributor(s) can fill out the appropriate award year paper (PDF) FAFSA form and mail it to:\nFederal Student Aid Programs\nAttn: COPPA Process\n25 Air Park Drive\nLondon, KY 40744-8236\nSuch applicants should not provide an email address on the application or any correction that might follow. After the\nFAFSA form is submitted, it will be processed and a paper FAFSA Submission Summary will be sent to the student and an\nISIR will be sent to schools. See Electronic Announcement APP-24-02 for additional information.\nProcessing the FAFSA\nApplications that are signed and submitted online go directly to the FPS. The paper FAFSA forms go to the FAFSA\nprocessor for data entry and then to the FPS. The FPS uses application data to calculate the SAI and to match the\nstudent9s information against several databases: NSLDS, the SSA, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as the\nDepartment of Homeland Security9s database of noncitizens.\nIndividuals Without a Social Security Number\nElectronic Announcement GENERAL-23-123\nElectronic Announcement GENERAL-24-52\nElectronic Announcement GENERAL-24-95\nElectronic Announcement GENERAL-24-140",
        "Chapter 4\nVerification, Updates, and Corrections\nBecause students sometimes make errors on their application, there is a process for verifying applications and making\ncorrections. The FAFSA Processing System (FPS) selects which applications are to be verified, but you also have the\nauthority to verify additional students.\nYou must verify applications selected by the FPS of students who will receive or have received subsidized Title IV aid, as\ndefined below. Verification is not required for students who are only eligible for unsubsidized Title IV aid (however, see\n<Verification exclusions= later in this chapter for an important caveat). While graduate students are ineligible for most\ntypes of subsidized Title IV aid, they are eligible for Federal Work-Study and would need to complete verification if they\nare selected and receive that aid. Students who are eligible for both subsidized and unsubsidized Title IV aid may not\navoid verification by accepting only unsubsidized aid; they must complete verification to receive any Title IV aid (see the\n<Disbursing unsubsidized aid= section later in this chapter for more information).\nRequired Policies and Procedures\nYour school must have written policies and procedures about the following:\nThe time in which students must submit verification documentation;\nThe consequences for failing to submit those documents in time;\nThe method you use to notify students if their Student Aid Index (SAI) and Title IV aid amounts change;\nThe procedures you or students follow to correct FAFSA data; and\nThe procedure you follow to refer a student to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) (see Chapter 5 of this volume).\nYour school must provide the following to students selected for verification in a timely manner:\nA clear explanation of their role in the process,\nA list of documents they need to submit, and\nDeadlines they must meet and the consequences of failing to meet them.\nThe FSA Assessments are located as additional resources in the FSA Handbook portion of the Knowledge Center. You can\nuse the verification assessment to evaluate your verification process. In addition, the Department has a list of questions\nand answers about verification located within our Program Integrity Q & A website.\nSubsidized student financial assistance programs\n34 CFR 668.52 <Subsidized student financial assistance programs=\nUnsubsidized student financial assistance programs\n34 CFR 668.52 <Unsubsidized student financial assistance programs=\nPolicies and Procedures",
        "Originate or disburse any additional Direct Loans (subsidized, unsubsidized, or PLUS).\nThe student must repay any FSEOG funds received that year. If the student fails to complete verification within your\nschool9s established timeframe and if you received any Direct Subsidized Loan funds for the student that you did not\ndisburse, you must return some or all those funds under the excess cash tolerance regulation (see Volume 4, Chapter 1 of\nthe FSA Handbook).\nIf the student provides the required documentation after your school9s deadline, you may, at your discretion, provide aid if\nstill within the Department9s overall verification deadlines.\nPell Grants\nA student selected for verification may submit a valid FAFSA Submission Summary or a school can receive a valid ISIR\nafter the Pell deadline but before the verification deadline published in the Federal Register. If a student does not provide\nthe verification documentation or you do not receive the valid FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR (if necessary) within\nthis additional time, they lose their Pell Grant eligibility for the award year and must return any Pell money already\nreceived for that year.\nOther Considerations\nThe Department may determine not to process the FAFSA form of an applicant who has been requested to provide\ndocumentation until they do so, or the Department decides there is no longer a need for it.\nA Pell applicant selected for verification must complete the process by the deadline published in the Federal Register. The\nnotice for the 2024-25 award year was published on September 18, 2024. The deadline for the 2024-25 award year is\nSeptember 20, 2025, or 120 days after the last day of the student9s enrollment, whichever is earlier. When the notice for\n2025-26 is published, the corresponding deadline date is expected to be mid-September 2026. Applicants to Campus-\nBased programs and the Direct Loan program must complete verification by the same deadline or by an earlier one your\naid office establishes.\nVerification is complete when you have all the requested documentation and a valid ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary\n(one on which all the information is accurate and complete). This includes any necessary corrections, which must be made\nby the Federal Register deadlines for submitting paper or electronic corrections.\nLate and Post-Withdrawal Disbursements\nGenerally, a student ceases to be eligible for aid once they have finished the payment period and/or is no longer enrolled.\nHowever, the student may submit verification documentation and receive a late disbursement after that time if the\nDepartment processed a FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR with an official SAI while they were still enrolled. For\ninformation on late disbursements, see Volume 4 of the FSA Handbook; for more information on post-withdrawal\ndisbursements, see Volume 5.\nVerification Status Codes\nWhen you disburse a Pell Grant, you must report the student9s verification status through the Common Origination and\nDisbursement (COD) System even if they were not selected for verification.\nV4You have verified the student. This includes students selected by the FPS and those your school chose to verify\nbased on its own criteria.\nVerification Completed Within Additional Time for Pell\n34 CFR 668.60(c)(1)",
        "Chapter 5\nSpecial Cases\nThere are unique situations where you will need to exercise your discretion as a financial aid administrator: when\nmodifying data used to calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI), adjusting a student9s cost of attendance (COA), performing\ndependency overrides, resolving conflicting information, reporting cases of fraud, and determining a student to be an\nunaccompanied homeless youth.\nThe following special cases are discussed in further detail in this chapter:\nYou may choose to exercise professional judgment (PJ) to adjust components of a student9s COA or the data that\ndetermine a student9s SAI to account for a student9s special circumstances.\nYou might also choose to exercise PJ to account for a student9s unusual circumstances that warrant making a\ndependent student an independent student.\nYou may need to determine if a student should be classified as an unaccompanied homeless youth.\nYou may need to resolve a discrepancy after receiving conflicting information for a student.\nIn some cases, you may suspect that a student or employee has fraudulently obtained federal funds and you must\nreport them to the Department.\nProfessional Judgment\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act (the Act) distinguishes between different categories of professional judgment by amending\nsection 479A of the HEA.\nSpecial Circumstances refer to the financial situations (loss of a job, etc.) that justify an aid administrator adjusting\ndata elements in the COA or in the SAI calculation.\nUnusual Circumstances refer to the conditions that justify an aid administrator making an adjustment to a\nstudent9s dependency status based on a unique situation (e.g., human trafficking, refugee or asylee status, parental\nabuse or abandonment, incarceration), more commonly referred to as a dependency override.\nA student may have both a special circumstance and an unusual circumstance. Financial aid administrators (FAAs) may\nmake adjustments that are appropriate to each student9s situation with appropriate documentation. See Dear Colleague\nLetter GEN-22-15 for additional guidance and discussion of the changes made by the FAFSA Simplification Act.\nSpecial Circumstances\nAn FAA may use PJ on a case-by-case basis to adjust the components of a student9s cost of attendance or the data used to\ncalculate their SAI. This adjustment is valid only at the school making the change.\nThe law gives some examples of special circumstances that may be considered (HEA Sec. 479A):\nChange in employment status, income, or assets;\nChange in housing status (e.g., homelessness);\nTuition expenses at an elementary or secondary school;\nAdditional family members enrolled in college;\nMedical, dental, or nursing home expenses not covered by insurance;\nChild or dependent care expenses;\nSevere disability of the student or other member of the student9s household; and\nOther changes or adjustments that impact the student9s costs or ability to pay for college.\nThis is not an exhaustive list. You may use your discretion to make appropriate, reasonable adjustments to reflect a\nstudent9s situation more accurately. You may also use your discretion to deny a student9s request for adjustment.\nHowever, you may not maintain a policy to deny all requests for special circumstance adjustments. Your institution must\ndevelop policies and a process for reviewing requests for professional judgment. Additionally, your institution must\npublicly disclose that students may request an adjustment based on special circumstances. This could include (but is not",
        "the 2025-26 award year. Students may update the answer to this question if their plans change or they progress to a\nhigher grade level during the award year.\nA student9s grade level is not based on the number of years the student has attended college but on work completed\ntoward the degree or certificate. For instance, a full-time student might attain second-year grade level after one year of\nstudy, while a half-time student would take two years to reach that level.\nThe student should also indicate whether they will have a first bachelor9s degree before beginning the 2025-26 year\nbecause eligibility for Pell and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity grants (FSEOG) is almost exclusively\nrestricted to students who have not received a bachelor9s degree or completed the requirements for one. See <General\nEligibility Requirements for Federal Pell Grants= in Volume 7, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook regarding degrees from\nunaccredited and foreign schools, which can count as bachelor9s degrees for Pell and FSEOG eligibility.\nIf the student indicates they have a first bachelor9s degree, they should also indicate if they will be pursuing an initial\nteaching certification at the elementary or secondary level. If a student answers <yes= to this question, you must evaluate\nand determine if the student is enrolled in a postbaccalaureate program for which a student may receive a Pell Grant. See\nVolume 7, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook regarding eligible postbaccalaureate programs.\nA student who is a graduate or professional student is independent for purposes of Title IV aid and not eligible for Pell\ngrants or other forms of undergraduate aid. If a Pell-eligible student incorrectly indicates they are working on a master9s,\ndoctorate, or graduate certificate program, they must submit a correction before they can receive a Pell grant. If a student\ncompletes an undergraduate program during the year and begins graduate school, the student can update the answer to\nthis question and the FPS will reprocess the student9s application.\nSee Volume 1, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook for definitions of undergraduate and graduate students.\nStudent Personal (5), Homelessness (6), or Unusual (7) Circumstances\nThe law governing the Title IV programs is based on the premise that the family is the first source of the student9s\nsupport, and the law provides several criteria that decide if the student is considered independent of their parents for aid\neligibility. Note that a student reaching the age of 18 or 21 or living apart from their parents does not on its own affect\ntheir dependency status.\nQuestions 5 and 6, along with information from other FAFSA questions, are used to determine if a student meets eligibility\ncriteria to be considered independent and not required to submit information about their parents. If a student is\nconsidered a dependent of their parents, the parents' must include their financial information on the FAFSA form. The FPS\nwill calculate a parent contribution and add it to the student9s contribution to derive an SAI.\nFor the 2025-26 year, a student who meets one or more of the following criteria is independent:\nFrom Question 1:\nUndergraduate student definition\n34 CFR 668.2(b) <Undergraduate student=\nGraduate student definition\n34 CFR 668.2(b) <Graduate or professional student=",

If the parent is completing their section of the form\nusing the paper (PDF) FAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field. In both application methods, the parent should\nenter their ITIN, if they have one, in the ITIN field.\nParent Contact Information (31)\nThis is the parent9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address.\nParent Current Marital Status (32)\nThis is the parent9s marital status <as of today= 3 the day the application is signed. Marital status cannot be projected. It\ncan be updated in limited circumstances; see Chapter 4.\nA student9s parent in a relationship that meets the criteria for common-law marriage in their state of legal residence\nshould select <married=. If the state doesn9t consider their situation to be a common-law marriage or doesn9t recognize\ncommon-law marriage, then they aren9t married; parents would report that they are unmarried and living together. Check\nwith the appropriate state agency concerning the definition of a common-law marriage.\nParent State of Legal Residence (33)\nThis is used to determine which poverty guideline to use when evaluating eligibility for a Maximum or Minimum Pell Grant\nfor a dependent student.\nFamily Size (34)\nSee <Family Size (9)= in the student section for further explanation of family size for online filers.\nFor paper (PDF) FAFSA filers, family size appears in both the student and parent contributor sections of the form. The\ninformation reported in the parent section of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form will supersede information reported in the\nstudent section, if applicable.\nThe following persons are included in the family size of a dependent student:\nThe student\nThe parent (and their spouse or partner)\nThe parent9s dependent children, (even if they live apart from the parents due to a qualifying temporary absence\nunder IRS code, such as living apart due to college enrollment) who will receive more than half of their support from\nthe parent (and spouse or partner) from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026. Unborn children should not be included\nin the family size, though the family size can be updated if the child is born and will receive more than half of their\nsupport from the parent (and spouse or partner) during the award year.\nOther persons who live with and receive more than half their support from the parent (and spouse or partner) and\nwill receive more than half support for the entire award year.\nNumber in College (35)\nWhile number in college is no longer used to calculate a student9s SAI, the FAFSA Simplification Act requires the question\nto be included on the FAFSA form. Schools can use the information provided to perform a special circumstance adjustment\nfor a student. See <Professional Judgment= in Chapter 5: Special Cases of this volume for additional information.\nThe student is always included in the number in college. Also included are those in the family size who are or will be\nenrolled at least half time during the award year in a degree or certificate program at a Title IV-eligible school.\nFederal Benefits Received (36)\nA student may be eligible to have their and their parents9 assets excluded from the SAI calculation if they (or someone in\ntheir family) received one (or more) federal benefits during the 2023 or 2024 calendar years. See the <Federal Benefits",
        "Examples of eligible noncitizen categories are given in the FAFSA instructions, and a detailed discussion of citizenship\nissues can be found in Volume 1 of the FSA Handbook. Only U.S. citizens or certain classes of noncitizens are eligible for\nTitle IV aid; however, other students can still submit the FAFSA form because they might be eligible for aid from\ninstitutional, state, or private sources that do not have the same requirements but use FAFSA information.\nStudents who select <Eligible noncitizen= should include their A-Number, if they have one.\nStudent State of Legal Residence (14)\nThis is used to determine which poverty guideline to use when evaluating eligibility for a Maximum or Minimum Pell Grant\nfor an independent student.\nThis is also used to determine which state agency should receive the student9s FAFSA information. States have varying\ncriteria for determining whether the student is a resident for purposes of their financial aid. However, residing in one state\nfor five years (or more) will meet any state9s criteria.\nParent Education Status (15)\nSome state agencies and institutions use this information to award grants and scholarships.\nParent Killed in the Line of Duty (16)\nA student may be eligible for a Maximum Pell Grant if they have a parent or guardian who died in the line of duty while\neither (1) serving on active duty as a member of the U.S. armed forces on or after September 11, 2001, or (2) performing\nofficial duties as a public safety officer. You should evaluate students who select <Yes= to this question for additional Pell\nGrant eligibility under HEA Sec. 401(c).

        "professional judgment by schools during the award years applicable to the qualifying emergency.\nThe Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, Maximum Pell Grant, and PJ\nThe amount a taxpayer claims as the foreign earned income exclusion counts as untaxed income on the FAFSA form.\nBecause this appears in untaxed income rather than the AGI, it will not be counted when determining students9 eligibility\nfor a maximum Pell Grant. As we noted in Dear Colleague Letter GEN-23-11, there will be a C flag on the ISIR that\nindicates to schools to review how the amount impacts a student9s eligibility for the maximum Pell Grant prior to awarding\naid. As we instructed in our online Q & As (SAI-Q5 and SAI-Q6) FAAs must review eligibility for applicants (and their spouse\nor parent) who reported receiving a foreign earned income exclusion and are eligible for the maximum Pell Grant award. If\nan ISIR contains both a Maximum Pell indicator flag and a valid value in the <Foreign Earned Income Exclusion= data field,\nwe will flag the ISIR for the FAA to review.\nThe FAA will determine4via manual or estimated SAI calculation4if adding the exempted foreign income to the adjusted\ngross income (AGI) would make the student ineligible to receive the maximum Pell Grant award. If that would occur, the\nFAA must determine whether it is appropriate to use PJ to account for the foreign income in determining the student9s\neligibility for the maximum Pell Grant. If the FAA decides that it is appropriate, the FAA may move the foreign earned\nincome amount from untaxed income to AGI or request additional documentation of the foreign income prior to\nperforming the adjustment. If the FAA decides to add the untaxed foreign earned income to the AGI, the FAA must check\nthe PJ flag on the ISIR before submitting the correction.\nRefusing or Reducing a Loan\nFAAs may also use their discretion to refuse or reduce Direct Loan funds if they document the reason, make the\ndetermination on a case-by-case basis, notify the student in writing, and ensure the decision is not due to discrimination\nbased on race, national origin, religion, sex, income, age, or disability.\nUnusual Circumstances\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act provides a clearer directive for FAAs to assist applicants with unusual circumstances to\nadjust dependency status on the FAFSA form to reflect students9 situations more accurately (dependency overrides). Like\nother types of professional judgments, institutions must make students aware of their ability to request an adjustment for\nForeign Earned Income Exclusion PJ Example\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 4: A dependent student9s parent has an overseas business that earns income for\nwhich the parent claims the foreign earned income exclusion on Schedule 1 of their IRS Form 1040. The FAA\nnotices this amount on the ISIR and that the Maximum Pell indicator flag has been set, which means that the FAA\nis required to review the case. The FAA does a manual calculation of the student9s SAI with the amount of the\nexclusion included as AGI rather than as untaxed income. Because the amount is the maximum that could be\nclaimed ($120,000 for tax year 2023, transferring the amount from untaxed income to AGI makes the student\nineligible for an automatic maximum Pell Grant. The FAA decides to use PJ to move the amount of the foreign\nearned income exclusion to the parent9s AGI.\nRefusing or Reducing a Loan\n34 CFR 685.301(a)(8)"

It confirms that their application is complete, details the information provided, and includes the Student Aid Index (SAI), results of eligibility matches, aid history, and any identified issues or inconsistencies. If the student has an email address, they receive a link to view their summary online; otherwise, a paper copy is mailed. This document helps students verify their application details, make necessary corrections, and serves as proof of submission during the aid consideration process.",

        "parent spouse or partner contributor section.\nParent Spouse or Partner Identity Information (42)\nLike the student, the parent spouse or partner identity information should match what appears on their social security\ncard. If the parent spouse or partner does not have a Social Security number and is completing their section of the form\nonline, the SSN field will automatically be blank based on the information in their StudentAid.gov account. If the parent\nspouse is completing their section using the paper (PDF) FAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field. In both\napplication methods, the parent should enter their ITIN, if they have one, in the ITIN field.\nParent Spouse or Partner Contact Information (43)\nThis is the parent spouse9s or partner9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address.\nParent Spouse or Partner Tax Filing Status (44)\nThis question asks if the parent spouse or partner filed (or will file) a 2023 IRS 1040 or 1040-NR. It also asks about income\nearned in a foreign country or if the parent spouse or partner filed a tax return in a U.S. territory. See the discussion of tax\nreturn data in the <Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the\nFA-DDX or be manually entered by the parent spouse or partner.\nParent Spouse or Partner 2023 Tax Return Information (45)\nThis information comes directly from the parent spouse9s or partner9s 2023 federal tax return. See the discussion of tax\nreturn data in the <Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the\nFA-DDX or be manually entered by the parent spouse or partner. Unlike the parent, the parent spouse or partner will not\nbe asked to report either (1) taxable college grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits, or (2) receipt of the earned\nincome credit. See <Student Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28)= for further explanation of these two excluded\nelements.\nParent Spouse or Partner Consent, Approval, and Signature (46)\nEvery parent spouse or partner contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The parent spouse or partner contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information\nto the IRS.\nApproval 3 The parent spouse or partner must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may\nreceive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The parent spouse or partner contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their\nsignature on the online FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nA dependent student with (1) unmarried parents living together or (2) a married or remarried parent who did not file their\n2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete FAFSA form ready for processing. The student will\nreceive an email confirmation that their FAFSA form is complete. The parent spouse or partner will see an abbreviated\nconfirmation that the form is complete, and that the student has been notified. If the applicant provided an email address,\nthey will receive an email when the FAFSA form is processed with instructions for accessing their FAFSA Submission\nSummary. Applicants without an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nRole: Preparer\nIf someone other than the student, student spouse, parent, or parent spouse or partner completed a portion of the FAFSA\nform on the applicant9s behalf, that person must complete the Preparer section. Paid preparers are prohibited. This\nsection consists of three questions related to the unpaid preparer.",
        "The FPS also checks the application for possible inconsistencies and mistakes. For instance, if a dependent student\nreported the parents9 marital status as married but reported the family size as <2,= the edit checks would catch the\ninconsistency. Even when data is inconsistent, the FPS may be able to calculate an SAI based on assumptions. Students\nwho submit applications online will be able to correct or confirm FPS edits before submitting the application.\nOutput Documents\nAfter processing is complete, the FPS produces output documents 3 the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) and\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary 3 that show the information the student originally provided, the SAI, results of the\neligibility matches, information about aid history, and information about any inconsistencies identified through the FPS\nedits. If the FPS was unable to calculate an SAI, the output record will not show one. The ISIR is made available\nelectronically to the schools the student listed on the FAFSA form (or added later) and their state agency. The FAFSA\nSubmission Summary is made available to the student online or a paper FAFSA Submission Summary is mailed to the\nstudent if the student is unable to access it online. The type of output document depends on the type of record that the\napplicant submitted. Neither the online nor the paper FAFSA Submission Summary will contain FTI. See Volume 6 of the\n2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide for additional information.\nYou will receive an ISIR for the student only if the applicant includes your school on their FAFSA form. If your school is not\nlisted, you can request an ISIR for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal by adding your federal school code if you\nhave the applicant9s Data Release Number (DRN), which authorizes your access to the student9s application information.\nThe DRN appears on the FAFSA Submission Summary, on the FAFSA confirmation page, and in the FAFSA confirmation\nemail.\nYou are required to receive ISIRs and to accept FAFSA Submission Summaries from students, but you cannot require\nstudents to submit FAFSA Submission Summaries to receive aid. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student, your federal\nschool code must be added to their record so that an ISIR is sent to you. We recommend making corrections electronically\nvia the online FAFSA (the student) or the FAFSA Partner Portal (the school); however, students can also use a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary to make corrections. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student who provided a FAFSA Submission\nSummary, you must use the FAFSA Submission Summary to package and disburse the student aid. Again, you must also\nensure that your school code is added to the student9s FPS record (see the <How to Submit Corrections and Updates=\nsection in Chapter 4).\nThe FAFSA Submission Summaries and ISIRs include comment codes and text explaining any questionable results from\nFAFSA processing. Some comment codes also have an associated C Flag, which you must resolve before paying the\nstudent aid. If a student9s FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR contains a comment code that requires resolution, the\nunderlying issue must be resolved before any Title IV funds may be disbursed to the student. For instance, if an applicant\nhas defaulted on a federal student loan, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will note this in several places,\nincluding comments to the applicant and the NSLDS financial aid history page. In addition, if a school disburses Title IV\nfunds to a student with a comment code that requires resolution and the student withdraws before the school has\nresolved the underlying issue, any funds disbursed must be returned to ED since the funds were provided to an otherwise\nineligible student.\nFor other problems, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will show that the FAFSA form has been rejected and no SAI\nhas been calculated. The FAFSA Submission Summary will tell the applicant how to resolve the reject by correcting errors\nor providing consent and approval, signatures, or more information. A complete list of comments, C Flags, reject codes,\nand required resolutions are available in Volume 7 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide.\nA valid output document (ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary) is one on which all the information reported on a student9s\nFAFSA form is accurate and complete as of the date the application is signed.\nValid Output Document\n34 CFR 668.2(b)",

If a contributor9s information is updated or corrected, that contributor also must sign the FAFSA\nSubmission Summary before submitting it for processing.\nStudents who applied electronically are encouraged to return to their Dashboard on StudentAid.gov to make corrections.\nStudents who applied electronically but would like to make corrections via paper may have a paper FAFSA Submission\nSummary mailed to them by calling the FSAIC at 1-800-4-FED-AID and providing their name, SSN, and date of birth,\nthough this feature may not be available until later in the application cycle.\nAdding Schools and Changing a Student9s Address\nAs with other changes, a student can add schools or change their address, email address, or telephone number online or\non a paper FAFSA Submission Summary. A student can also update these items over the phone by calling 1-800-433-3243\nand providing their DRN, though this feature may not be available until later in the application cycle. You can submit\nthose changes for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal if your school is listed on the student9s application, or you\nhave the student9s DRN.\nThe FAFSA form has limited space for a student to list schools that will receive the application data: 10 schools can be\nlisted on the paper application; 20 schools can be listed on the online FAFSA form. If the student wants information sent to\nmore schools, the student can use any of the methods listed previously to replace some or all the original schools. If the\nstudent originally listed 20 schools on the application and then replaced two schools with two new ones, those that were\nreplaced will not receive an ISIR from this correction or any subsequent correction on which they did not appear.\nSignatures\nAny required signatures, such as those on worksheets or on copies of tax returns, must be collected at the time of\nverification4they cannot be collected after the verification deadline for that award year.\nFor verification documentation, a school may collect an electronic signature for an applicant, parent, or spouse if the\nprocess includes an assurance of the identity of the person signing.

A pending username and password that has not been verified will still\nallow the user to access and submit the online FAFSA form and complete other limited actions on StudentAid.gov.\nHowever, the Department will not be able to retrieve federal tax data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For this\nreason, we recommend that users do not sign and submit the online FAFSA form until the account username and\npassword is verified through a match with the SSA.\nIf the SSN match is unsuccessful, the account is not considered verified, and an email is sent to notify the individual that\nthey should review the information they provided (name, date of birth, and SSN) to ensure it is accurate. If the applicant\nused an unverified account username and password to sign their FAFSA form, the applicant is also sent a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary requesting all required signatures.\nTransUnion® Knowledge-Based Identity Verification\nUsers who create a StudentAid.gov account without an SSN will be required to complete a knowledge-based identity\nverification process with TransUnion® to verify their identity and provide login credentials.

Among other things, the student agrees to spend Title IV funds only\non educational expenses and affirms that they are not in default on a federal loan and do not owe a grant overpayment.\nFAFSA Submission\nStudents who do not have any other required contributors now have a complete FAFSA form. Students who complete and\nsubmit their FAFSA form online will receive an email version of their confirmation page. When the applicant9s FAFSA form\nis processed, students who provided an email address will receive an email notification of processing with instructions to\naccess their FAFSA Submission Summary.

        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3.\nThe easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported. However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form.\nFUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form.\nConsent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper).\nTo provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department.\nFAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",
        "Chapter 1\nThe Application Process: FAFSA to ISIR\nThe laws governing the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs require that a person apply for aid with a form provided by\nthe U.S. Department of Education (ED, Department) and that no fee be charged for processing it. This form is the Free\nApplication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form.\nTo be considered for federal student aid, a student must complete a FAFSA form. It collects financial and other information\nused to calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI; formerly Expected Family Contribution or EFC) and to determine a student9s\neligibility through computer matches with other agencies.\nThe FAFSA form is the only application students must complete to apply for Title IV aid. A school cannot require extra\ninformation from students to package Title IV aid, except for verification, resolution of conflicting information, or\nprofessional judgment determinations. However, a school may require additional information for other purposes, such as\npackaging private or institutional aid. If the school collects additional information that affects Title IV eligibility, it must\ntake the information into account when awarding Title IV aid.\nTypes of FAFSA Applications\nMore than 99% of FAFSA forms are filed electronically. However, there are other options for individuals unwilling or unable\nto file electronically.\nFAFSA Online\nImplementation of the FAFSA Simplification Act and the FUTURE Act required a complete overhaul of the FAFSA form,\nbeginning with the 2024-25 award year. Submitted FAFSA forms are sent directly to the FAFSA Processing System (FPS).\nHelp is available for students online or by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-4-FED-AID\n(1-800-433-3243).\nThere are many advantages to filing electronically, including:\nFaster processing;\nAvailability of online help;\nSkip logic, which allows applicants to skip over questions that don9t pertain to them; and\nFewer errors and rejected applications because internal and end-of-entry data edits ensure that required fields are\ncompleted and conflicts are resolved prior to submission.\nPaper (PDF) FAFSA Form\nThe paper (PDF) FAFSA form is available on StudentAid.gov. In future cycles, students will also be able to call the Federal\nStudent Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-433-3243 to request a single copy.\nThe form can be printed and completed by hand, or by typing the data on the PDF before printing and mailing it. The\nmailing address is printed on the first page of the FAFSA form under <Mail Your FAFSA® Form=. The address changes\nannually, so use the address printed on the associated year9s FAFSA form.\nYou must mail all fillable pages of the form (pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to\nthe applicant. Extra postage will be required due to the size and/or weight of the mailing.\nFSA no longer prints or mails aid-related publications, though they are available on StudentAid.gov for users to download\nand print.\nIncarcerated Applicants\nIncarcerated applicants who have access to the necessary technology can complete a FAFSA form online using their\nStudentAid.gov account username and password. However, many incarcerated applicants will not be able to file",

        "Application and Verification Guide\nIntroduction\nThis guide is intended for college financial aid administrators and counselors who help students with the financial aid\nprocess4completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, verifying information, and making\ncorrections and other changes to the information reported on the FAFSA form.\nThroughout the Federal Student Aid Handbook, we use <college,= <school,= and <institution= interchangeably unless a\nmore specific use is given. Similarly, <student,= <applicant,= and <aid recipient= are synonyms. <Parents= in this volume\nrefers to the legal parents of dependent students, and <you= refers to the primary audience of the Handbook: financial aid\nadministrators at colleges. <We= indicates the U.S. Department of Education (the Department, ED), and <federal student\naid= and <Title IV aid= are synonymous terms for the financial aid offered by the Department.\nWe appreciate any comments that you have on the Application and Verification Guide (AVG), as well as all the volumes of\nthe FSA Handbook. We revise the text based on questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please\nreach out to us about how to improve the FSA Handbook through the <Contact Customer Support= feature in our Partner\nConnect Help Center clicking on <FSA Handbook= under the Topic section.\nFAFSA Simplification Act\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a\nsignificant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need\nanalysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the\nFAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for\nEducation (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process.\nChanges From the FUTURE Act\nThe Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data\nexchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate\ncompleting the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data\nRetrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX\neliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information\nreported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered\nverified for Title IV purposes.\nUnlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s\nspouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via\nthe FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid.\nOther Changes\nThroughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references\nhave been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year.\nWhere appropriate, links and publications associated with FSA9s Partner Connect and Knowledge Center have been\nproperly updated. We also removed references to COVID-19 guidance and waivers.\nSome sections were moved to better align topics and assist with narrative flow. Use the search feature to find sections\nthat may have been relocated. The following describes changes made in each chapter.\nChapter 1: The Application Process\nWe removed the <Returning FAFSA Filers= section as FAFSA renewal functionality has been deferred for future cycles."

This data may be transferred from the IRS via the FA-DDX or manually entered if unavailable.\n\n2. **Satisfaction of Consent and Signature Requirements:** Confirmation that the student and contributors have provided necessary consent, approval, and signatures (FSA ID or physical signatures) for the use and disclosure of FTI and other data.\n\n3. **Verification Flags and Comments:** Indicators of issues or discrepancies identified in the application, such as comment codes requiring resolution, verification tracking groups, and C Flags that may impact eligibility or disbursements.\n\n4. **Application Data and Demographics:** Including identity information, marital status, state of residence, family size, number in college, and contact details, which are used for eligibility calculations and matches.\n\n5. **Processing and Verification Status:** Such as whether the application has been verified, selected for identity verification, or contains inconsistent or conflicting information that needs review.\n\n6. **School Information:** The federal school code of the institution receiving the aid, and other school-specific data related to the application.\n\n7. **Additional Data:** Comments, reject codes, and information about corrections or updates made to the application.\n\nIt's important to note that the ISIR does not display information related to other schools listed on the FAFSA unless sent to state agencies, nor does it contain actual FTI beyond what is transferred from the IRS. All data are subject to Department rules governing confidentiality and proper handling.\n\nIn summary, the ISIR provides a comprehensive snapshot of the applicant's federal aid eligibility data, tax information (if available and verified), application status, and any issues needing resolution, which are crucial for financial aid decision-making.",

        "Indicators for Schedules A, B, D, E, F, H\nIRS response code\nIn some limited circumstances, the student or contributor may need to manually provide data if it is unavailable through\nthe FA-DDX or does not reflect their current personal circumstances. In these cases, manually entered data will be used in\nthe SAI calculation. For example, a contributor would be required to manually report income and tax data if they were\nmarried and filed their 2023 U.S. tax return jointly with their spouse but are now divorced.\nIRS Response Codes\nThe IRS will provide one of the following response codes for each contributor, and they will appear on a student9s ISIR.\nCode\nIndication\n200\nUsable FTI data retrieved successfully\n214\nNo return on file\n203\n206\n212\nNo usable FTI data retrieved\nThe IRS provides a response code value of <200= when the IRS has data and it was successfully shared with FSA for\ninclusion on the applicant9s FAFSA form. Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler.\nIRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution.\nContributors\n<Contributor= refers to anyone who is required to provide information, consent, and approval, and a signature on the\nFAFSA form. The FAFSA form is organized by contributor. Each contributor will complete their own section of the form\nwhich contains specific questions and instructions pertaining to that contributor. The guidance in this chapter\nsupplements those instructions and explains why some of the questions are needed on the FAFSA form.\nThe following sections discuss the questions found within each contributor section on the FAFSA form. The parents\nmentioned are the legal parents of dependent students. The numbers in parentheses are for the items as they appear on\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary, ISIR, paper (PDF) FAFSA, and FAFSA Partner Portal. The FAFSA form is considered a\n<snapshot= of the family9s information as of the date the application is signed and it can be updated only in certain\ncircumstances and only for certain items. See Chapter 4 for more information about updating a FAFSA form.\nContributor: Student\nThis section consists of 24 questions related to the student.\nStudent Identity Information (1)\nThis question requests the name, date of birth, and Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification\nNumber (ITIN) of the student contributor. The name, with other identifying information, is used for several data matches.",
        "2. The disclosure of their FTI by the IRS to the Department;\n3. The use of their FTI by a Department official to determine an applicant9s eligibility for federal student aid and the\namount for which they are eligible; and\n4. The redisclosure of FTI by the Department to an eligible institution, state higher education agency, or a designated\nscholarship organization (e.g., institutional or state financial aid).\nOnly the Department has the authority to obtain approval and consent for the use and disclosure of FTI for such purposes.\nOur partners (FAAs, advocates, etc.) are not permitted to obtain approval and consent on behalf of FAFSA contributors\n(including parent(s) or spouse) for the use and disclosure of FTI.\nOnce a FAFSA contributor has provided consent and approval for use and disclosure of FTI for a FAFSA cycle (e.g., the\n2025-26 FAFSA cycle), they cannot revoke consent for that cycle. The ability to revoke consent is not needed for FAFSA\npurposes because the FAFSA contributor is providing a one-time consent for a specific tax year and an annual consent is\nrequired for each FAFSA cycle.\nStudents and contributors are not able to view or edit the imported FTI data. This is to enhance security, privacy, and to\nreduce the risk of the misuse of sensitive data. However, you (the financial aid administrator) will be able to see the\ntransferred data on the ISIR. Schools and other partners that receive ISIRs must protect federal student aid information\nprovided to them by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the application, award, and administration of the\nfederal student aid programs as permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA, as amended. In keeping with the\nexpectation that you protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, you must not disclose FTI\nfrom the FAFSA form unless the disclosure and use is permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA 1098h. For additional\ninformation and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34.\nSignatures\nEach student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS\nand (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per\napplication cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a\nprocessed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is\naccurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction\nto contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating\nthat the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their\nFAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect\nthe necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature\nrequirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval. Only the Department can collect a contributor9s\nconsent and approval.\nFederal Tax Information\nThe following data received by the Department from the IRS are considered FTI:\nTax Year (ex.

        "The ISIR will only display the federal school code of the receiving school. The information of other schools the student\nincluded on the FAFSA form will not appear except on the FAFSA Submission Summary and on ISIRs sent to state grant\nagencies. See Volume 6 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specification Guide.\nStudent Consent, Approval, and Signature (24)\nEvery student must provide the following to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The student must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the IRS.\nApproval 3 The student must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may receive, use, and\nredisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The student9s FSA ID (account username and password) will serve as their signature on the online\nFAFSA form. Paper (PDF) FAFSA form filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nIn addition to certifying that the data on the FAFSA form is correct, the student is also signing a statement of educational\npurpose, which is required to receive Title IV funds. Among other things, the student agrees to spend Title IV funds only\non educational expenses and affirms that they are not in default on a federal loan and do not owe a grant overpayment.\nFAFSA Submission\nStudents who do not have any other required contributors now have a complete FAFSA form. Students who complete and\nsubmit their FAFSA form online will receive an email version of their confirmation page. When the applicant9s FAFSA form\nis processed, students who provided an email address will receive an email notification of processing with instructions to\naccess their FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their\nFAFSA Submission Summary. Applicants with additional required contributors will need these individuals to contribute to\ntheir FAFSA form, as described next.\nContributor: Student Spouse\nThis section consists of five questions related to the student9s spouse. The student9s spouse is a required contributor on\nthe FAFSA form if the student is married and did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse.\nIf a married student is completing the FAFSA form online and the student9s spouse is identified as a required contributor,\nthe student will be prompted to enter their spouse9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and\nemail address) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The student spouse will be notified by email that they\nhave been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The spouse should use their own StudentAid.gov account\nusername and password to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s\nspouse is not a required contributor, the student will enter the same identifying information and email address, but the\nstudent9s spouse will not be invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their spouse complete the student spouse\ncontributor section.\nStudent Spouse Identity Information (25)\nLike the student, the student spouse identity information should match what appears on their social security card. If the\nstudent spouse does not have a Social Security number and is completing their section of the form online, the SSN field\nwill be blank, based on their StudentAid.gov account information. If they are completing their section on the paper (PDF)\nFAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field. In both application methods, the student spouse should enter their\nITIN, if they have one, in the ITIN field.\nStudent Spouse Contact Information (26)\nThis is the student spouse9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address.\nStudent Spouse Tax Filing Status (27)",
        "reconcile the conflicting information and take appropriate action under the specific program requirements (depending on\nthe outcome, funds may have to be returned).\nSubsequent ISIRs\nYou are generally required to review all subsequent transactions for a student for the entire processing year even if you\nverified an earlier transaction. An exception to this requirement is if a later transaction comes in after the student is no\nlonger enrolled at your institution. Review the SAI, C flag, or verification tracking group for changes. Review new\ncomments or NSLDS information that impacts eligibility for aid. Check any updates or corrections. If the SAI has not\nchanged and there are no changes in the C flag, verification tracking group, or NSLDS information, no action is generally\nrequired. If the SAI does change but it either doesn9t affect the amount and type of aid received or the data elements that\nchanged were already verified, no action is required. But if the SAI changes and the pertinent data elements were not\nverified, then you must investigate. Of course, any time the C flag changes or NSLDS data have been modified, you must\nresolve any conflicts.\nDiscrepant Tax Data\nFinancial aid administrators do not need to be tax experts, but there are some issues that even a layperson with basic tax\nlaw information can evaluate. Because conflicting data often involve such information, FAAs must have a fundamental\nunderstanding of relevant tax issues that can impact the need analysis. You are obligated to know (1) whether a person\nwas required to file a tax return and (2) what the correct filing status for a person should be. The IRS9s online Interactive\nTax Assistant can help with these and other issues by walking the user through a series of questions. IRS Publication 17 is\nalso a useful resource.\nResolution of Conflicting Information\nYou must resolve conflicting information prior to disbursing aid to a student enrolled at your school. Even if the conflict\nconcerns a previous award year, you must still investigate it. You have resolved the matter when you have\ndetermined which data are correct; this might simply be confirming that an earlier determination was the right one. You\nmust document your findings and include an explanation that justifies your decision.\nThe verification page on the FSA Assessments site has guidance to help you review your conflicting information\nprocedures; see Activity 1.\nReferral of Fraud Cases\nRequirement to Verify Questionable Data\n34 CFR 668.54(a)(2)\nDiscrepant Tax Data Example\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 7: An FAA notices that a dependent student9s parents, who are married and live\ntogether, have each filed as head of household (which offers a greater tax deduction than filing as single or\nmarried). The FAA must ask if that is the right status. Resolution of the conflict could be the parents refiling and\nsubmitting a copy of the amended return or a reasonable explanation of why there is no conflict under IRS rules.",
        "The FPS also checks the application for possible inconsistencies and mistakes. For instance, if a dependent student\nreported the parents9 marital status as married but reported the family size as <2,= the edit checks would catch the\ninconsistency. Even when data is inconsistent, the FPS may be able to calculate an SAI based on assumptions. Students\nwho submit applications online will be able to correct or confirm FPS edits before submitting the application.\nOutput Documents\nAfter processing is complete, the FPS produces output documents 3 the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) and\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary 3 that show the information the student originally provided, the SAI, results of the\neligibility matches, information about aid history, and information about any inconsistencies identified through the FPS\nedits. If the FPS was unable to calculate an SAI, the output record will not show one. The ISIR is made available\nelectronically to the schools the student listed on the FAFSA form (or added later) and their state agency. The FAFSA\nSubmission Summary is made available to the student online or a paper FAFSA Submission Summary is mailed to the\nstudent if the student is unable to access it online. The type of output document depends on the type of record that the\napplicant submitted. Neither the online nor the paper FAFSA Submission Summary will contain FTI. See Volume 6 of the\n2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide for additional information.\nYou will receive an ISIR for the student only if the applicant includes your school on their FAFSA form. If your school is not\nlisted, you can request an ISIR for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal by adding your federal school code if you\nhave the applicant9s Data Release Number (DRN), which authorizes your access to the student9s application information.\nThe DRN appears on the FAFSA Submission Summary, on the FAFSA confirmation page, and in the FAFSA confirmation\nemail.\nYou are required to receive ISIRs and to accept FAFSA Submission Summaries from students, but you cannot require\nstudents to submit FAFSA Submission Summaries to receive aid. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student, your federal\nschool code must be added to their record so that an ISIR is sent to you. We recommend making corrections electronically\nvia the online FAFSA (the student) or the FAFSA Partner Portal (the school); however, students can also use a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary to make corrections. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student who provided a FAFSA Submission\nSummary, you must use the FAFSA Submission Summary to package and disburse the student aid. Again, you must also\nensure that your school code is added to the student9s FPS record (see the <How to Submit Corrections and Updates=\nsection in Chapter 4).\nThe FAFSA Submission Summaries and ISIRs include comment codes and text explaining any questionable results from\nFAFSA processing. Some comment codes also have an associated C Flag, which you must resolve before paying the\nstudent aid. If a student9s FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR contains a comment code that requires resolution, the\nunderlying issue must be resolved before any Title IV funds may be disbursed to the student. For instance, if an applicant\nhas defaulted on a federal student loan, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will note this in several places,\nincluding comments to the applicant and the NSLDS financial aid history page. In addition, if a school disburses Title IV\nfunds to a student with a comment code that requires resolution and the student withdraws before the school has\nresolved the underlying issue, any funds disbursed must be returned to ED since the funds were provided to an otherwise\nineligible student.\nFor other problems, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will show that the FAFSA form has been rejected and no SAI\nhas been calculated. The FAFSA Submission Summary will tell the applicant how to resolve the reject by correcting errors\nor providing consent and approval, signatures, or more information. A complete list of comments, C Flags, reject codes,\nand required resolutions are available in Volume 7 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide.\nA valid output document (ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary) is one on which all the information reported on a student9s\nFAFSA form is accurate and complete as of the date the application is signed.\nValid Output Document\n34 CFR 668.2(b)",

Unborn children should not be included\nin the family size, though the family size can be updated if the child is born and will receive more than half of their\nsupport from the parent (and spouse or partner) during the award year.\nOther persons who live with and receive more than half their support from the parent (and spouse or partner) and\nwill receive more than half support for the entire award year.\nNumber in College (35)\nWhile number in college is no longer used to calculate a student9s SAI, the FAFSA Simplification Act requires the question\nto be included on the FAFSA form. Schools can use the information provided to perform a special circumstance adjustment\nfor a student. See <Professional Judgment= in Chapter 5: Special Cases of this volume for additional information.\nThe student is always included in the number in college. Also included are those in the family size who are or will be\nenrolled at least half time during the award year in a degree or certificate program at a Title IV-eligible school.\nFederal Benefits Received (36)\nA student may be eligible to have their and their parents9 assets excluded from the SAI calculation if they (or someone in\ntheir family) received one (or more) federal benefits during the 2023 or 2024 calendar years. See the <Federal Benefits",
        "guidance on returning aid in such situations in Volume 4, Chapter 3 of the FSA Handbook.\nAfter Documentation Is Complete\nWhen you have obtained all necessary verification documents from the student, you should compare them to the FAFSA\nSubmission Summary or ISIR you are reviewing for payment. If all the student9s information is correct or has been\ncorrected and there are no outstanding issues or unresolved conflicting information, you may award and disburse aid for\nwhich the student is eligible.\nSometimes schools ask if even further verification is needed to resolve discrepancies between the ISIR and what the\nstudent provided for verification. The answer is no unless you have reason to doubt the accuracy of the verification\ninformation. Acceptable documentation either confirms that an item was right on the ISIR, or it is used to correct that\nitem. That is the purpose of verification; continued fact-finding is not necessary.\nHow to Submit Corrections and Updates\nCorrections and updates can be submitted by the student on the FAFSA Submission Summary or the web or by the school\nusing the FAFSA Partner Portal or the Electronic Data Exchange (EDE). In addition to the following information, see also\nVolume 3 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide.\nOnline FAFSA Form. Students and other contributors can correct previously submitted data that was not imported from\nthe IRS.\nFAFSA Partner Portal or EDE. An FAA can submit corrections to a student9s application data using the FAFSA Partner\nPortal. Your school can submit corrections and updates electronically by entering the data manually in the FAFSA Partner\nPortal or by transmitting it to the FAFSA Processing System. However, you cannot update an applicant9s or contributor9s\npersonally identifiable information (PII) or consent and approval using EDE, a third-party software, or the FAFSA Partner\nPortal.\nIf your school isn9t listed on the transaction you want to correct, the student must provide you with the DRN printed on the\nFAFSA Submission Summary. You can then add your school in the next available institution field and gain electronic\naccess to the resulting corrected transaction. If all the fields are filled, the student must add your school code using the\nFAFSA online.\nCorrections and updates sent by a school must be based on reliable documentation in its possession that supports the\nchanges to applicant data or signed documentation from the student or contributor. Examples of reliable documentation\ninclude applications for admission, acceptance letters, course registration information, or academic transcripts. Examples\nof signed documentation from a student or contributor on which corrections and updates may be based include a FAFSA\nSubmission Summary, a copy of the correction or update, student/contributor statement, verification documents, or\ncopies of tax returns or transcripts. These do not have to be wet signatures.\nThe FPS will process the change, send an ISIR to the school, and send the student an updated FAFSA Submission\nNote: Batch corrections and updates may not be available at the time you need to begin making such corrections\nor updates. However, these instructions are provided for future use when this functionality becomes available.\nNote: Some student-initiated corrections have been flagged incorrectly as school-initiated corrections on the\nresulting ISIR transaction. The Department is aware of this defect and working to find a resolution. If your school is\naware of a transaction that is flagged incorrectly as a school-initiated correction, you should notate the student9s\nfile. You are not required to collect documentation unless you have conflicting information or reason to believe the\ninformation on the ISIR transaction is incorrect.",

The IRS is more concerned whether a person is a resident or nonresident\nrather than a legal or illegal alien. An alien is anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or national. A resident alien is one who\neither is a permanent resident or has resided in the U.S. for a specific minimum amount of time (has met the substantial\npresence test). All others are nonresident aliens. Resident aliens9 income is generally subject to tax in the same manner\nas U.S. citizens9, and they file Form 1040. Nonresident aliens who are required to file a return submit Form 1040NR, which\nis acceptable documentation for verification.\nImmigrants who do not have an SSN and are unable to get one can apply with the IRS for an individual taxpayer\nidentification number (ITIN). The ITIN is only for tax purposes. It does not authorize a person to work, endorse his or her\nlegal status, or entitle them to the earned income credit or Social Security benefits.\nSee the IRS9s Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens at www.irs.gov for more information.\nInterim Disbursements\nInterim disbursements are allowed either prior to completing verification or after verification but before receiving the\ncorrected FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR. If you have no reason to question the accuracy of the information on the\nFAFSA form, prior to completing verification you may at your discretion:\nMake one disbursement of Pell and FSEOG funds for the applicant9s first payment period;\nPermit FWS employment for the first 60 consecutive days after the student enrolls for the award year; or\nOriginate but not disburse a Direct Subsidized Loan.\nIf verification results in changes to the FAFSA information that you determine will not alter award amounts, you may at\nyour discretion also disburse a Direct Subsidized Loan prior to receiving the corrected valid FAFSA Submission Summary\nor ISIR (defined as a FAFSA Submission summary or ISIR on which all the information reported on a student9s FAFSA form\nis accurate and complete as of the date the application is signed).\nOverpayments From Interim Disbursements\nIf you make an interim disbursement of Pell or FSEOG funds prior to verification and the student9s eligibility for Title IV\nfunds changes after you complete verification, your school is liable for any resulting overpayment. If you can9t eliminate it\nby reducing subsequent disbursements or having the student return the money, your school must use its own funds to\nVerification for Confined or Incarcerated Individuals\n34 CFR Part 668 Subpart P\nDear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10\nInterim Disbursements\n34 CFR 668.58",

A pending username and password that has not been verified will still\nallow the user to access and submit the online FAFSA form and complete other limited actions on StudentAid.gov.\nHowever, the Department will not be able to retrieve federal tax data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For this\nreason, we recommend that users do not sign and submit the online FAFSA form until the account username and\npassword is verified through a match with the SSA.\nIf the SSN match is unsuccessful, the account is not considered verified, and an email is sent to notify the individual that\nthey should review the information they provided (name, date of birth, and SSN) to ensure it is accurate. If the applicant\nused an unverified account username and password to sign their FAFSA form, the applicant is also sent a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary requesting all required signatures.\nTransUnion® Knowledge-Based Identity Verification\nUsers who create a StudentAid.gov account without an SSN will be required to complete a knowledge-based identity\nverification process with TransUnion® to verify their identity and provide login credentials. The student (if a citizen of one\nof the Freely Associated States - the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, or the Federated States of\nMicronesia), student9s spouse, parent, or parent spouse/partner are sent through the TransUnion® process when they do\nnot have an SSN and check the <I don9t have an SSN= box during the account creation process. They will be asked to\nprovide additional information to confirm their identity.\nFAFSA Filers Under the Age of 13\nBecause the Children9s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 prohibits any entity, including a government\nagency, from electronically conducting business or communicating with a person under age 13, applicants who are 12 or\nyounger cannot complete the FAFSA form online.

For example, if IRS Form 1040,\nline 1z is $50,000 and Schedule 1, line 3 is -$10,000, the income earned from work value should be $50,000.\nUsing the Tax Transcript\nIf applicants or contributors are unable to transfer data via the FA-DDX, the student, spouse, and/or parents, as\napplicable, can use an IRS tax return transcript to document information from the tax return. Before requesting a\ntranscript, they should allow enough time to pass after filing the return; it takes the IRS two to four weeks to process\nreturns filed electronically and six to eight weeks for mailed returns. Tax transcripts submitted to your school for\nverification do not need to be signed by the tax filer (but it is encouraged) unless you have reason to doubt their\nauthenticity.\nThere are a few ways to request a tax return transcript. The IRS provides instructions on all options at\nwww.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript. Per the IRS, the fastest and easiest way is to access personal tax records online,\nwhich allows the tax filer to get a real-time, electronic transcript. Tax filers who opt to request transcripts by mail or\nphone will receive a mailed transcript in return. Schools can accept and copy transcripts originally obtained from the IRS.\nThe IRS9s Income Verification Express Service (IVES) allows a third party to request and receive a tax filer9s transcript. The\nIVES participant submits a 4506-C form, signed by the tax filer, and receives the transcript from the IRS, which charges a\nsmall fee for the service. Schools may apply to participate in IVES. They may also use a transcript from another IVES\nparticipant (which is not considered a third-party servicer in this case) for verification if they have no reason to doubt its\nauthenticity. Schools may not pass on the charge for using this service to the student.\nTo combat identity theft, the IRS masks much of the personally identifiable information on the transcript. For example,\nonly the last four digits of any SSN or account or telephone number are displayed. When requesting a transcript,\ntaxpayers will be prompted to create a <customer file number= which appears on a requested transcript to help facilitate\nidentification. This can be something like a student9s college ID number or some other number (but not an SSN). See the\nOctober 4, 2018, announcement and the IRS news release for more information.\nEach year the Department provides a tax return transcript matrix to assist schools with reviewing tax data. Specifically,\nthe tax return transcript matrix consists of a chart of the FAFSA and ISIR tax items used for verification and their\ncorresponding line items from the various IRS tax returns and the tax transcript for the appropriate award year. At the\ntime the 2025-26 Application and Verification Guide was published, the 2023 tax return transcript matrix had not been",

This may be the same number as your AGI.\nFiscal Year Tax Returns\nFor a fiscal year (rather than calendar year) tax return, the individual should use information from the return that includes\nthe greater length of time in 2023. For example, an individual who files a fiscal year tax return that begins in September\nwould have two tax returns that overlap the 2023 calendar year 3 September 1, 2022, thru August 31, 2023, (FY23) and\nSeptember 1, 2023, thru August 31, 2024, (FY24). Since the FY23 tax return covers 8 months of the 2023 calendar year\nand the FY24 tax return covers 4 months of the 2023 calendar year, the individual should use the FY23 tax return that\nbegins on September 1, 2022, to complete the FAFSA form.\nNote: There are more days in the year between July 1 and December 31 (184 days) than between January 1 and June 30\n(181, or 182 in a leap year). Keep that in mind when determining the length of time attributed to a fiscal year tax return\nthat begins on July 1.\nStudent 2023 Tax Return Information (20)\nFor U.S. tax filers, much of the information in Question 20 will be transferred directly from the IRS via the FA-DDX.\nHowever, as noted previously, there will be instances where manual entry of tax information will be necessary.\nThis information comes directly from the 2023 federal tax return of the student9s (and the student9s spouse, if married\nand filed jointly with their current spouse). Non-tax filers will not be required to provide this information. The first list\nbelow is data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX, if available.

See the discussion of tax\nreturn data in the <Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the\nFA-DDX or be manually entered by the parent spouse or partner. Unlike the parent, the parent spouse or partner will not\nbe asked to report either (1) taxable college grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits, or (2) receipt of the earned\nincome credit. See <Student Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28)= for further explanation of these two excluded\nelements.\nParent Spouse or Partner Consent, Approval, and Signature (46)\nEvery parent spouse or partner contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The parent spouse or partner contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information\nto the IRS.\nApproval 3 The parent spouse or partner must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may\nreceive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The parent spouse or partner contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their\nsignature on the online FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nA dependent student with (1) unmarried parents living together or (2) a married or remarried parent who did not file their\n2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete FAFSA form ready for processing. The student will\nreceive an email confirmation that their FAFSA form is complete. The parent spouse or partner will see an abbreviated\nconfirmation that the form is complete, and that the student has been notified. If the applicant provided an email address,\nthey will receive an email when the FAFSA form is processed with instructions for accessing their FAFSA Submission\nSummary. Applicants without an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nRole: Preparer\nIf someone other than the student, student spouse, parent, or parent spouse or partner completed a portion of the FAFSA\nform on the applicant9s behalf, that person must complete the Preparer section. Paid preparers are prohibited. This\nsection consists of three questions related to the unpaid preparer.",
        "A student may move from Verification Tracking Group V1 or V4 to group V5 based on corrections made to their FPS record\nor on other information available to the Department. If verification was already completed for the previous group, the\nstudent is only required to verify the V5 information that was not already verified. If verification was not completed for the\nprevious group, the student needs to verify all the V5 information.\nNo disbursements of Title IV aid may be made until the V5 verification is satisfactorily completed. If the student doesn9t\ncomplete verification, the school is not liable for any Title IV aid it disbursed prior to receiving the group V5 ISIR. The\nstudent is liable for the full amount because without verification there is no evidence they were eligible for that aid. See\nthe October 31, 2016 Electronic Announcement for more information about disbursements and potential return of funds\nwhen students are selected for verification.\nReporting Results for Groups V4 and V5\nYou must report the verification results of identity for any student for whom you (1) receive an ISIR with tracking flag V4\nor V54as selected by the FPS, not your school4and (2) request verification documentation.\nYou are required to report results no more than 60 days following your first request to the student for documentation of\nidentity. Inaccurate and untimely reporting may subject your school to findings on your annual compliance audit or a\nprogram review. If there is a change in a result you have already submitted, you can submit the new code using the\nabove process and must make that change within 30 days of becoming aware that a change occurred. The most recent\nsubmission will supplant prior award year submissions.\nIndividual Reporting\nWhen the Verification of Identity function is available in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), you will see a list of applications\nwho were selected for either V4 or V5 identity verification who also listed your school on their FAFSA form. You can filter\nthe list by Name or SSN or sort the records alphabetically, in ascending or descending order. You can select from the\nfollowing dropdown options:\nDisplay all 3 Default option;\nDisplay not submitted 3 Displays only applicants for whom no results have been provided; or\nDisplay submitted 3 Displays only the applicants for whom results have been provided.\nFor the 2025-26 award year, you will then enter one of the following numeric codes that most applies:\n1-Verification completed in person, no issues found\n2-Verification completed remotely, no issues found\n3-Verification attempted, issues found with identity. (You did not receive acceptable documentation for the SEP or\nidentity.)\n5-No response from applicant or unable to locate\nNote: Numeric codes 4 and 6 are reserved by the Department for future use.\nBatch Reporting\nBatch reporting may not be available at the time you are required to begin reporting identity verification for the 2025-26\naward year. However, these instructions are provided for future use when this functionality becomes available.\nNote: The following section provides guidance based on the assumption that the Verification of Identity\nfunctionality is available in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP). However, this functionality was delayed and may not\nbe available. The Department provided flexibility to report any V4 or V5 initial identity outcomes or changes within\n60 days or 30 days respectively of the normal timeframe requirement or when the FPP Verification of Identity\nfunction becomes available, whichever is later. See Electronic Announcement GENERAL-24-63 for additional\ninformation.",
        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3.\nThe easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported. However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form.\nFUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form.\nConsent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper).\nTo provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department.\nFAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",

        "2. The disclosure of their FTI by the IRS to the Department;\n3. The use of their FTI by a Department official to determine an applicant9s eligibility for federal student aid and the\namount for which they are eligible; and\n4. The redisclosure of FTI by the Department to an eligible institution, state higher education agency, or a designated\nscholarship organization (e.g., institutional or state financial aid).\nOnly the Department has the authority to obtain approval and consent for the use and disclosure of FTI for such purposes.\nOur partners (FAAs, advocates, etc.) are not permitted to obtain approval and consent on behalf of FAFSA contributors\n(including parent(s) or spouse) for the use and disclosure of FTI.\nOnce a FAFSA contributor has provided consent and approval for use and disclosure of FTI for a FAFSA cycle (e.g., the\n2025-26 FAFSA cycle), they cannot revoke consent for that cycle. The ability to revoke consent is not needed for FAFSA\npurposes because the FAFSA contributor is providing a one-time consent for a specific tax year and an annual consent is\nrequired for each FAFSA cycle.\nStudents and contributors are not able to view or edit the imported FTI data. This is to enhance security, privacy, and to\nreduce the risk of the misuse of sensitive data. However, you (the financial aid administrator) will be able to see the\ntransferred data on the ISIR. Schools and other partners that receive ISIRs must protect federal student aid information\nprovided to them by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the application, award, and administration of the\nfederal student aid programs as permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA, as amended. In keeping with the\nexpectation that you protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, you must not disclose FTI\nfrom the FAFSA form unless the disclosure and use is permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA 1098h. For additional\ninformation and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34.\nSignatures\nEach student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS\nand (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per\napplication cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a\nprocessed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is\naccurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction\nto contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating\nthat the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their\nFAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect\nthe necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature\nrequirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval. Only the Department can collect a contributor9s\nconsent and approval.\nFederal Tax Information\nThe following data received by the Department from the IRS are considered FTI:\nTax Year (ex. Award year 2025-26 is based on 2023 tax year information from the IRS)\nTax Filing Status\nAdjusted Gross Income (AGI)\nNumber of Exemptions and Number of Dependents\nIncome Earned from Work\nTaxes Paid\nEducational Credits\nUntaxed IRA distributions\nIRA deductions and payments\nTax exempt interest\nUntaxed pension amounts\nSchedule C net profit/loss",
        "must not put the seal of the Department of Education on any verification documents.\nThe one exception is that schools must use the exact language provided in the <Statement of Educational Purpose= for\nstudents who are placed in verification tracking groups V4 or V5. This does not include the accompanying notary9s\ncertificate of acknowledgment; for that the school may use some other form, such as the one its state uses.\nIncome Information for Tax Filers\nAs already noted, the importation of IRS tax data (FTI) via the FA-DDX serves as verification documentation. Applicants\nand contributors will not see or be given the option to change FTI imported directly from the IRS via the FA-DDX. Data\ntransferred in this manner is considered verified, but there may be other data elements that must still be verified with\nadditional documentation.\nFAFSA\nInformation\nAcceptable Documentation\n(a) Adjusted\nGross\nIncome\n(AGI)\n(b) Income\nEarned from\nWork\n(c) U.S.\nIncome Tax\nPaid\n(d) Untaxed\nPortions of\nIRA\nDistributions\n(e) Untaxed\nPortions of\nPensions\n(f) IRA\nDeductions\nand\nPayments\n(g) Tax\nExempt\nInterest\nIncome\n(h)\nEducation\nCredits\n(i) Foreign\nIncome\nExempt\nfrom Federal\nTaxation\nItems (a) through (h), if transferred directly from the IRS and unchanged, do not need to be verified.\nWhen information is not transferred from the IRS, and for item (i), the following documentation is\nsufficient for verification:\n(1) A transcript obtained at no cost from the IRS or other relevant tax authority of a U.S. territory\n(Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands) or commonwealth (Puerto Rico and the Northern\nMariana Islands), or a foreign government, that lists 2023 tax account information of the tax filer; or\n(2) A signed copy of the income tax return)and the applicable schedules that were filed with the IRS\nor other relevant tax authority of a U.S. territory, or a foreign government that lists 2023 tax account\ninformation of the tax filer.\n(3) If item (d) or (e) contains a rollover, a signed statement confirming the amount of the rollover in\nthe untaxed pension or IRA distribution. Note that even if (d) or (e) are transferred as FTI, rollovers\nstill need to be verified as they are manually entered.\nQualified rollovers from one retirement account to another are not taxable, and they should not be counted as untaxed\nincome (Untaxed portions of IRA distributions (d) or Pensions (e) above). Since neither a tax transcript nor FTI transferred\nvia the FA-DDX identifies rollovers, you must get documentation from the tax filer. This could be a signed statement with\nthe rollover amount or a notation by the filer on the tax transcript or return that includes the word <rollover= beside any",
        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3.\nThe easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported. However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form.\nFUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form.\nConsent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper).\nTo provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department.\nFAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",
        "Indicators for Schedules A, B, D, E, F, H\nIRS response code\nIn some limited circumstances, the student or contributor may need to manually provide data if it is unavailable through\nthe FA-DDX or does not reflect their current personal circumstances. In these cases, manually entered data will be used in\nthe SAI calculation. For example, a contributor would be required to manually report income and tax data if they were\nmarried and filed their 2023 U.S. tax return jointly with their spouse but are now divorced.\nIRS Response Codes\nThe IRS will provide one of the following response codes for each contributor, and they will appear on a student9s ISIR.\nCode\nIndication\n200\nUsable FTI data retrieved successfully\n214\nNo return on file\n203\n206\n212\nNo usable FTI data retrieved\nThe IRS provides a response code value of <200= when the IRS has data and it was successfully shared with FSA for\ninclusion on the applicant9s FAFSA form. Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler.\nIRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution.\nContributors\n<Contributor= refers to anyone who is required to provide information, consent, and approval, and a signature on the\nFAFSA form. The FAFSA form is organized by contributor. Each contributor will complete their own section of the form\nwhich contains specific questions and instructions pertaining to that contributor. The guidance in this chapter\nsupplements those instructions and explains why some of the questions are needed on the FAFSA form.\nThe following sections discuss the questions found within each contributor section on the FAFSA form. The parents\nmentioned are the legal parents of dependent students. The numbers in parentheses are for the items as they appear on\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary, ISIR, paper (PDF) FAFSA, and FAFSA Partner Portal. The FAFSA form is considered a\n<snapshot= of the family9s information as of the date the application is signed and it can be updated only in certain\ncircumstances and only for certain items. See Chapter 4 for more information about updating a FAFSA form.\nContributor: Student\nThis section consists of 24 questions related to the student.\nStudent Identity Information (1)\nThis question requests the name, date of birth, and Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification\nNumber (ITIN) of the student contributor. The name, with other identifying information, is used for several data matches.",
        "Students or parents who file an amended return (IRS Form 1040X) and provide consent and approval to retrieve FTI via\nthe FA-DDX will not have their amended information transferred to the FAFSA form. The IRS will transfer only original tax\ninformation to the FAFSA form via the FA-DDX. However, there is currently no indicator on the FAFSA form that the tax\nreturn was amended and the original data may be inaccurate. If you are aware that an applicant or contributor filed an\namended return, you must update or correct the applicant9s FAFSA form. You must also check the PJ flag on the corrected\nISIR transaction so that FPS recalculates the student9s SAI and Pell Grant eligibility using the manually entered tax\ninformation (instead of the FTI received via the FA-DDX).\nIf the applicant is selected for verification and you are aware that the applicant or a contributor has filed an amended\nreturn, you must use the amended return information to complete verification. However, if you were not previously aware\nthat an applicant or contributor filed an amended return, you are not required to confirm whether an amended return was\nfiled as part of the verification process. You may still consider the FTI transferred from the IRS to be verified if you have no\nreason to believe the applicant or a contributor filed an amended return.\nApplicants or contributors may submit a signed copy of the filed 1040X form and one of the following documents to\ncomplete verification:\nIncome and tax information from the IRS on an ISIR record with all tax information from the original tax return;\nA transcript obtained from the IRS that lists 2023 tax account information of the tax filer(s); or\nA signed copy of the 2023 IRS Form 1040 and the applicable schedules that were filed with the IRS.\nBecause the tax return transcript does not reflect changes to the original return by the filer or the IRS, it is, by itself, not\nsufficient.\nWhen an amended return was filed, you must submit any changes to nondollar items and to single monetary items of $25\nor more.\nNote that there may be instances when a student, spouse, or parent did not file a 1040X with the IRS but had their tax\nand income information amended by the IRS. In such a case a school may accept one of the items mentioned above plus\ndocumentation showing the IRS9s change(s).\nVictims of Tax-Related Identity Theft\nIndividuals who are victims of tax-related identity theft cannot get a return transcript or have their FTI transferred via the\nFA-DDX.\nIn the past we have requested individuals who are victims of IRS tax-related identity theft to obtain a Tax Return\nDataBase View (TRDBV) transcript from the IRS for verification purposes. However, the Department is aware that TRDBV\ntranscript requests have been taking over a year to process. Due to the long processing time, we will instead require\nindividuals who are victims of IRS tax-related identity theft to provide a copy of the following:\nA signed copy of the 2023 income tax return and applicable schedules the individual filed with the IRS; and\nAn IRS 4674C letter (a letter from the IRS acknowledging the identity theft) or a statement signed and dated by the\ntax filer indicating that he or she was a victim of IRS tax-related identity theft, and the IRS is aware of it.\nThis change to required documentation was provided in Dear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10.\nVerification for Confined or Incarcerated Individuals\nConfined or incarcerated individuals enrolled in approved prison education programs (PEPs) are eligible for Federal Pell\nGrants.\nFor the 2025-26 award year, a confined or incarcerated individual as indicated through the incarcerated applicant flag will\nonly be required to verify their identity and statement of educational purpose if selected for Verification Tracking Group\nV4 or V5. In addition, institutions are not required to verify a confined or incarcerated individual selected under\nVerification Tracking Flag V1.\nIf a confined or incarcerated student is unable to submit a signed and notarized statement of educational purpose, a\nschool may accept a signed statement from an authorized official who works for the correctional facility or the oversight",

For example, if IRS Form 1040,\nline 1z is $50,000 and Schedule 1, line 3 is -$10,000, the income earned from work value should be $50,000.\nUsing the Tax Transcript\nIf applicants or contributors are unable to transfer data via the FA-DDX, the student, spouse, and/or parents, as\napplicable, can use an IRS tax return transcript to document information from the tax return. Before requesting a\ntranscript, they should allow enough time to pass after filing the return; it takes the IRS two to four weeks to process\nreturns filed electronically and six to eight weeks for mailed returns. Tax transcripts submitted to your school for\nverification do not need to be signed by the tax filer (but it is encouraged) unless you have reason to doubt their\nauthenticity.\nThere are a few ways to request a tax return transcript. The IRS provides instructions on all options at\nwww.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript. Per the IRS, the fastest and easiest way is to access personal tax records online,\nwhich allows the tax filer to get a real-time, electronic transcript. Tax filers who opt to request transcripts by mail or\nphone will receive a mailed transcript in return. Schools can accept and copy transcripts originally obtained from the IRS.\nThe IRS9s Income Verification Express Service (IVES) allows a third party to request and receive a tax filer9s transcript. The\nIVES participant submits a 4506-C form, signed by the tax filer, and receives the transcript from the IRS, which charges a\nsmall fee for the service. Schools may apply to participate in IVES. They may also use a transcript from another IVES\nparticipant (which is not considered a third-party servicer in this case) for verification if they have no reason to doubt its\nauthenticity. Schools may not pass on the charge for using this service to the student.\nTo combat identity theft, the IRS masks much of the personally identifiable information on the transcript. For example,\nonly the last four digits of any SSN or account or telephone number are displayed. When requesting a transcript,\ntaxpayers will be prompted to create a <customer file number= which appears on a requested transcript to help facilitate\nidentification. This can be something like a student9s college ID number or some other number (but not an SSN). See the\nOctober 4, 2018, announcement and the IRS news release for more information.\nEach year the Department provides a tax return transcript matrix to assist schools with reviewing tax data. Specifically,\nthe tax return transcript matrix consists of a chart of the FAFSA and ISIR tax items used for verification and their\ncorresponding line items from the various IRS tax returns and the tax transcript for the appropriate award year. At the\ntime the 2025-26 Application and Verification Guide was published, the 2023 tax return transcript matrix had not been",

This may be the same number as your AGI.\nFiscal Year Tax Returns\nFor a fiscal year (rather than calendar year) tax return, the individual should use information from the return that includes\nthe greater length of time in 2023. For example, an individual who files a fiscal year tax return that begins in September\nwould have two tax returns that overlap the 2023 calendar year 3 September 1, 2022, thru August 31, 2023, (FY23) and\nSeptember 1, 2023, thru August 31, 2024, (FY24). Since the FY23 tax return covers 8 months of the 2023 calendar year\nand the FY24 tax return covers 4 months of the 2023 calendar year, the individual should use the FY23 tax return that\nbegins on September 1, 2022, to complete the FAFSA form.\nNote: There are more days in the year between July 1 and December 31 (184 days) than between January 1 and June 30\n(181, or 182 in a leap year). Keep that in mind when determining the length of time attributed to a fiscal year tax return\nthat begins on July 1.\nStudent 2023 Tax Return Information (20)\nFor U.S. tax filers, much of the information in Question 20 will be transferred directly from the IRS via the FA-DDX.\nHowever, as noted previously, there will be instances where manual entry of tax information will be necessary.\nThis information comes directly from the 2023 federal tax return of the student9s (and the student9s spouse, if married\nand filed jointly with their current spouse). Non-tax filers will not be required to provide this information. The first list\nbelow is data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX, if available.

Individuals who complete the FAFSA form\nonline, provide the required consent and approval to retrieve and use IRS FTI, and have their tax data successfully\ntransferred via the FA-DDX will not be asked to report the size of their family as their family size will be derived from that\nFTI. Instead, these individuals will be asked if their family size is different from the number of individuals claimed on their\ntax return. If they indicate there was a change, they will be asked to manually report their number of dependents in a\nfollow-up question.\nOn the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, family size appears in both the student and parent contributor sections. Dependent\nstudents are instructed to skip Question 9 on the paper (PDF) FAFSA form. Dependent students completing the online\nFAFSA form will not see the family size question in the student section.\nThe following persons are included in the family size of an independent student:\nThe student and their spouse, unless the spouse has died or is not living in the household due to separation or\ndivorce.\nThe student9s dependent children, if they live with the student (or live apart from the student due to a qualifying\ntemporary absence under IRS code, such as living apart due to college enrollment) and will receive more than half of\ntheir support from the student (and spouse) from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026. Unborn children should not be\nincluded in the family size, though the family size can be updated if the child is born and will receive more than half\nof their support from the student (and spouse) during the award year.\nOther persons, who live with and receive more than half their support from the student and will receive more than\nhalf support for the entire award year. For FAFSA forms submitted after the start of the year, see the relevant\nparagraph and example about legal dependents provided earlier in this chapter under the <Children and Legal\nDependents= section.\nNumber in College (10)\nWhile number in college is no longer used to calculate a student9s SAI, the FAFSA Simplification Act requires the question\nto be included on the FAFSA form. Schools can use the information provided to perform a special circumstance adjustment\nfor a student. See <Professional Judgment= in Chapter 5 of this volume for additional information.\nThe student is always included in the number in college. Also included are those in the family size who are or will be\nenrolled at least half time during the award year in a degree or certificate program at a Title IV-eligible school.\nStudent Demographic Information (11) and Student Race and Ethnicity (12)\nThese questions collect sex/gender and race/ethnicity information about the student. The answers to these questions will\nnot affect the student9s eligibility for federal student aid, be used in any calculations, or be shared with the schools to\nwhich the student applies. They will be used for research purposes only.\nStudent Citizenship (13)\nFamily Size Example\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 8: A married student recently separated from their spouse, and they are no longer\nliving together. They have a child together who is currently living with the student9s spouse. The student is paying\nchild support to the spouse, but it isn9t enough to provide more than half the child9s support. The spouse and child\ncannot be included in the student9s family size, even though the student and spouse are not yet legally divorced.\nHowever, the student9s nephew lives with the student and receives more than half of their support from the\nstudent (and will do so for the award year).

        "Application and Verification Guide\nIntroduction\nThis guide is intended for college financial aid administrators and counselors who help students with the financial aid\nprocess4completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, verifying information, and making\ncorrections and other changes to the information reported on the FAFSA form.\nThroughout the Federal Student Aid Handbook, we use <college,= <school,= and <institution= interchangeably unless a\nmore specific use is given. Similarly, <student,= <applicant,= and <aid recipient= are synonyms. <Parents= in this volume\nrefers to the legal parents of dependent students, and <you= refers to the primary audience of the Handbook: financial aid\nadministrators at colleges. <We= indicates the U.S. Department of Education (the Department, ED), and <federal student\naid= and <Title IV aid= are synonymous terms for the financial aid offered by the Department.\nWe appreciate any comments that you have on the Application and Verification Guide (AVG), as well as all the volumes of\nthe FSA Handbook. We revise the text based on questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please\nreach out to us about how to improve the FSA Handbook through the <Contact Customer Support= feature in our Partner\nConnect Help Center clicking on <FSA Handbook= under the Topic section.\nFAFSA Simplification Act\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a\nsignificant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need\nanalysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the\nFAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for\nEducation (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process.\nChanges From the FUTURE Act\nThe Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data\nexchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate\ncompleting the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data\nRetrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX\neliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information\nreported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered\nverified for Title IV purposes.\nUnlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s\nspouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via\nthe FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid.\nOther Changes\nThroughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references\nhave been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year.\nWhere appropriate, links and publications associated with FSA9s Partner Connect and Knowledge Center have been\nproperly updated. We also removed references to COVID-19 guidance and waivers.\nSome sections were moved to better align topics and assist with narrative flow. Use the search feature to find sections\nthat may have been relocated. The following describes changes made in each chapter.\nChapter 1: The Application Process\nWe removed the <Returning FAFSA Filers= section as FAFSA renewal functionality has been deferred for future cycles.",
        "The FPS also checks the application for possible inconsistencies and mistakes. For instance, if a dependent student\nreported the parents9 marital status as married but reported the family size as <2,= the edit checks would catch the\ninconsistency. Even when data is inconsistent, the FPS may be able to calculate an SAI based on assumptions. Students\nwho submit applications online will be able to correct or confirm FPS edits before submitting the application.\nOutput Documents\nAfter processing is complete, the FPS produces output documents 3 the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) and\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary 3 that show the information the student originally provided, the SAI, results of the\neligibility matches, information about aid history, and information about any inconsistencies identified through the FPS\nedits. If the FPS was unable to calculate an SAI, the output record will not show one. The ISIR is made available\nelectronically to the schools the student listed on the FAFSA form (or added later) and their state agency. The FAFSA\nSubmission Summary is made available to the student online or a paper FAFSA Submission Summary is mailed to the\nstudent if the student is unable to access it online. The type of output document depends on the type of record that the\napplicant submitted. Neither the online nor the paper FAFSA Submission Summary will contain FTI. See Volume 6 of the\n2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide for additional information.\nYou will receive an ISIR for the student only if the applicant includes your school on their FAFSA form. If your school is not\nlisted, you can request an ISIR for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal by adding your federal school code if you\nhave the applicant9s Data Release Number (DRN), which authorizes your access to the student9s application information.\nThe DRN appears on the FAFSA Submission Summary, on the FAFSA confirmation page, and in the FAFSA confirmation\nemail.\nYou are required to receive ISIRs and to accept FAFSA Submission Summaries from students, but you cannot require\nstudents to submit FAFSA Submission Summaries to receive aid. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student, your federal\nschool code must be added to their record so that an ISIR is sent to you. We recommend making corrections electronically\nvia the online FAFSA (the student) or the FAFSA Partner Portal (the school); however, students can also use a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary to make corrections. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student who provided a FAFSA Submission\nSummary, you must use the FAFSA Submission Summary to package and disburse the student aid. Again, you must also\nensure that your school code is added to the student9s FPS record (see the <How to Submit Corrections and Updates=\nsection in Chapter 4).\nThe FAFSA Submission Summaries and ISIRs include comment codes and text explaining any questionable results from\nFAFSA processing. Some comment codes also have an associated C Flag, which you must resolve before paying the\nstudent aid. If a student9s FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR contains a comment code that requires resolution, the\nunderlying issue must be resolved before any Title IV funds may be disbursed to the student. For instance, if an applicant\nhas defaulted on a federal student loan, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will note this in several places,\nincluding comments to the applicant and the NSLDS financial aid history page. In addition, if a school disburses Title IV\nfunds to a student with a comment code that requires resolution and the student withdraws before the school has\nresolved the underlying issue, any funds disbursed must be returned to ED since the funds were provided to an otherwise\nineligible student.\nFor other problems, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will show that the FAFSA form has been rejected and no SAI\nhas been calculated. The FAFSA Submission Summary will tell the applicant how to resolve the reject by correcting errors\nor providing consent and approval, signatures, or more information. A complete list of comments, C Flags, reject codes,\nand required resolutions are available in Volume 7 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide.\nA valid output document (ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary) is one on which all the information reported on a student9s\nFAFSA form is accurate and complete as of the date the application is signed.\nValid Output Document\n34 CFR 668.2(b)"

A pending username and password that has not been verified will still\nallow the user to access and submit the online FAFSA form and complete other limited actions on StudentAid.gov.\nHowever, the Department will not be able to retrieve federal tax data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For this\nreason, we recommend that users do not sign and submit the online FAFSA form until the account username and\npassword is verified through a match with the SSA.\nIf the SSN match is unsuccessful, the account is not considered verified, and an email is sent to notify the individual that\nthey should review the information they provided (name, date of birth, and SSN) to ensure it is accurate. If the applicant\nused an unverified account username and password to sign their FAFSA form, the applicant is also sent a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary requesting all required signatures.\nTransUnion® Knowledge-Based Identity Verification\nUsers who create a StudentAid.gov account without an SSN will be required to complete a knowledge-based identity\nverification process with TransUnion® to verify their identity and provide login credentials. The student (if a citizen of one\nof the Freely Associated States - the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, or the Federated States of\nMicronesia), student9s spouse, parent, or parent spouse/partner are sent through the TransUnion® process when they do\nnot have an SSN and check the <I don9t have an SSN= box during the account creation process. They will be asked to\nprovide additional information to confirm their identity.\nFAFSA Filers Under the Age of 13\nBecause the Children9s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 prohibits any entity, including a government\nagency, from electronically conducting business or communicating with a person under age 13, applicants who are 12 or\nyounger cannot complete the FAFSA form online. Instead, when they apply for financial aid, the student and required\ncontributor(s) can fill out the appropriate award year paper (PDF) FAFSA form and mail it to:\nFederal Student Aid Programs\nAttn: COPPA Process\n25 Air Park Drive\nLondon, KY 40744-8236\nSuch applicants should not provide an email address on the application or any correction that might follow. After the\nFAFSA form is submitted, it will be processed and a paper FAFSA Submission Summary will be sent to the student and an\nISIR will be sent to schools. See Electronic Announcement APP-24-02 for additional information.\nProcessing the FAFSA\nApplications that are signed and submitted online go directly to the FPS. The paper FAFSA forms go to the FAFSA\nprocessor for data entry and then to the FPS.

In these cases, manually entered data will be used in\nthe SAI calculation. For example, a contributor would be required to manually report income and tax data if they were\nmarried and filed their 2023 U.S. tax return jointly with their spouse but are now divorced.\nIRS Response Codes\nThe IRS will provide one of the following response codes for each contributor, and they will appear on a student9s ISIR.\nCode\nIndication\n200\nUsable FTI data retrieved successfully\n214\nNo return on file\n203\n206\n212\nNo usable FTI data retrieved\nThe IRS provides a response code value of <200= when the IRS has data and it was successfully shared with FSA for\ninclusion on the applicant9s FAFSA form. Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler.\nIRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution.\nContributors\n<Contributor= refers to anyone who is required to provide information, consent, and approval, and a signature on the\nFAFSA form. The FAFSA form is organized by contributor. Each contributor will complete their own section of the form\nwhich contains specific questions and instructions pertaining to that contributor. The guidance in this chapter\nsupplements those instructions and explains why some of the questions are needed on the FAFSA form.\nThe following sections discuss the questions found within each contributor section on the FAFSA form. The parents\nmentioned are the legal parents of dependent students. The numbers in parentheses are for the items as they appear on\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary, ISIR, paper (PDF) FAFSA, and FAFSA Partner Portal.

You must mail all fillable pages of the form\n(pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to the applicant. Extra postage will be\nrequired due to the size and/or weight of the mailing.\nFAFSA Partner Portal\nThe FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP) replaced FAA Access to CPS Online beginning with the 2024-25 award year. FSA\ndecommissioned the FAA Access site after the 2023324 application cycle closed.\nThe FAFSA Partner Portal removed the ability for a financial aid administrator (FAA) to initiate a new application on behalf\nof a student. This is due to the requirement in the FUTURE Act that all FAFSA form contributors (including students,\nspouses, and parents) must provide their consent to disclose information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\napproval to retrieve and use certain Federal Tax Information (FTI). FAAs cannot provide consent and approval on behalf of\nany other person. Therefore, you will not be able to use the FPP to start and submit a new FAFSA form on an applicant9s\nbehalf. However, you can make certain corrections or updates.\nTranslation Assistance\nThe FAFSA form is available in English and Spanish. If you need assistance completing the form in English or Spanish\ncontact the FSAIC at 1-800-433-3243. Translation assistance in additional languages is available by calling 1-833-610-\n2590 and pressing <7= to request a specific language.\nAccount Username and Password (FSA ID)\nThe account username and password, also known as the FSA ID, is used to access a person9s StudentAid.gov account. It\nserves as an electronic signature and a digital identifier to allow access to various ED systems and services for students,\nspouses of students, parents, or spouses/partners of parents. Therefore, each individual must create their own account\nand should not share their login credentials with anyone, including FAAs. Users can create an account online at\nStudentAid.gov quickly and securely. See Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-123 for additional information on\ncreating a StudentAid.gov account for individuals without a Social Security number.\nEach person who provides data in the online FAFSA form must have an account username and password to access the\nform. In the past, a Social Security number (SSN) was required to create a StudentAid.gov account. Starting with the\n2024325 award year, all individuals4even those without an SSN4can create a StudentAid.gov account. Persons with an\nSSN will still have their information verified by the Social Security Administration (SSA), while those without an SSN will\nuse the TransUnion® knowledge-based identity verification process described below.\nThe account username and password are created in real-time so that the student or other contributor can use it\nimmediately to enter the FAFSA form.

Paper (PDF) FAFSA form filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nIn addition to certifying that the data on the FAFSA form is correct, the student is also signing a statement of educational\npurpose, which is required to receive Title IV funds. Among other things, the student agrees to spend Title IV funds only\non educational expenses and affirms that they are not in default on a federal loan and do not owe a grant overpayment.\nFAFSA Submission\nStudents who do not have any other required contributors now have a complete FAFSA form. Students who complete and\nsubmit their FAFSA form online will receive an email version of their confirmation page. When the applicant9s FAFSA form\nis processed, students who provided an email address will receive an email notification of processing with instructions to\naccess their FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their\nFAFSA Submission Summary. Applicants with additional required contributors will need these individuals to contribute to\ntheir FAFSA form, as described next.\nContributor: Student Spouse\nThis section consists of five questions related to the student9s spouse. The student9s spouse is a required contributor on\nthe FAFSA form if the student is married and did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse.\nIf a married student is completing the FAFSA form online and the student9s spouse is identified as a required contributor,\nthe student will be prompted to enter their spouse9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and\nemail address) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The student spouse will be notified by email that they\nhave been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The spouse should use their own StudentAid.gov account\nusername and password to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s\nspouse is not a required contributor, the student will enter the same identifying information and email address, but the\nstudent9s spouse will not be invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their spouse complete the student spouse\ncontributor section.\nStudent Spouse Identity Information (25)\nLike the student, the student spouse identity information should match what appears on their social security card. If the\nstudent spouse does not have a Social Security number and is completing their section of the form online, the SSN field\nwill be blank, based on their StudentAid.gov account information. If they are completing their section on the paper (PDF)\nFAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field. In both application methods, the student spouse should enter their\nITIN, if they have one, in the ITIN field.\nStudent Spouse Contact Information (26)\nThis is the student spouse9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address.\nStudent Spouse Tax Filing Status (27)",
        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3.\nThe easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported. However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form.\nFUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form.\nConsent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper).\nTo provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department.\nFAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",
        "Because the Department matches the student9s name and SSN with the Social Security Administration (SSA), the name on\nthe FAFSA form should match the one in the SSA9s records (i.e., as it appears on the student9s Social Security card).\nStudents (except citizens of one of the Freely Associated States 3 see <Account Username and Password= in Chapter 1)\nmust have an SSN to apply for federal student aid. If they submit a paper (PDF) FAFSA form without an SSN, the FAFSA\nform will be returned unprocessed. Students will be unable to submit a FAFSA form electronically without an account\nusername and password, which requires an SSN (except students who are citizens one of the Freely Associated States).\nThe student must contact the local SSA office to get an SSN or to find out what the number is if they lost their Social\nSecurity card. Go to https://www.ssa.gov/number-card for more information.\nIf the student9s name, date of birth, or SSN does not match with the Social Security Administration, the student typically\nneeds to resolve the issue with the SSA. If the information submitted is correct, the student must contact SSA to update\nits records. After the student receives confirmation that SSA has corrected its records, the student must contact the\nFederal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) and ask them to manually sync their data with SSA. Alternatively, if the\nstudent notifies the school that they received confirmation from SSA, the FAA may update the Resend to Matches field to\n<Y= in the FAFSA Partner Portal and submit it as a correction so the transaction can go back to SSA for an updated match\nflag. Records sent for rematching will continue to receive this match flag until SSA updates its database.\nStudents who enter their name, date of birth, or SSN incorrectly should log in to StudentAid.gov and update their\ninformation in Account Settings. The record will be resent to SSA for matching. Once SSA verifies the account, the\nstudent should update their FAFSA form by submitting a correction.\nStudent Contact Information (2)\nThis is the student9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address, with three exceptions:\nStudents under the age of 13 should not provide an email address as FSA cannot communicate with them\nelectronically. See <FAFSA Filers Under the Age of 13= in Chapter 1 for additional information.\nIncarcerated students should use an address where they can reliably receive mail. This may be the physical address\nof the facility they are in, the address of the school (if permitted by the school), or a central processing facility used\nby the facility for mail distribution. If a prison ID number is required by the facility for the applicant to receive mail,\nthe applicant should list that at the end of the address field. If an incarcerated student is released, they should also\nupdate their address in their StudentAid.gov account or on their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nHomeless students should use a mailing address where they can reliably receive mail. That can be the address of a\nrelative or friend who has given them permission to use it, or it can be their school9s address if they have contacted\nthe school for permission and instructions on how mail they receive at the school will reach them. As soon as\nhomeless students have more permanent housing, they should update their address in their StudentAid.gov account\nor on their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nIf the student provides an email address, they should get an email with a link to their online FAFSA Submission Summary\nwithin one to three days after the FPS receives the completed application. The Department will also use this email address\nto correspond with the student regarding their application.\nStudent Current Marital Status (3)\nThis is marital status <as of today= 3 the day the application is signed. Marital status cannot be projected. It can be\nupdated in limited circumstances; see Chapter 4.\nA student who is only engaged should select <single (never married)= unless they wait until after their marriage date to\ncomplete the FAFSA form. A student in a relationship that meets the criteria for common-law marriage in their state of\nlegal residence should select <married= and will be considered independent. A student who is separated from their spouse\nshould select <separated= and will be considered a dependent student for FAFSA purposes, unless they meet other criteria\nto be considered an independent student.\nStudent College or Career School Plans (4)\nStudents should answer this question based on the degree or certificate program they will be working on at the start of",
        "guidance on returning aid in such situations in Volume 4, Chapter 3 of the FSA Handbook.\nAfter Documentation Is Complete\nWhen you have obtained all necessary verification documents from the student, you should compare them to the FAFSA\nSubmission Summary or ISIR you are reviewing for payment. If all the student9s information is correct or has been\ncorrected and there are no outstanding issues or unresolved conflicting information, you may award and disburse aid for\nwhich the student is eligible.\nSometimes schools ask if even further verification is needed to resolve discrepancies between the ISIR and what the\nstudent provided for verification. The answer is no unless you have reason to doubt the accuracy of the verification\ninformation. Acceptable documentation either confirms that an item was right on the ISIR, or it is used to correct that\nitem. That is the purpose of verification; continued fact-finding is not necessary.\nHow to Submit Corrections and Updates\nCorrections and updates can be submitted by the student on the FAFSA Submission Summary or the web or by the school\nusing the FAFSA Partner Portal or the Electronic Data Exchange (EDE). In addition to the following information, see also\nVolume 3 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide.\nOnline FAFSA Form. Students and other contributors can correct previously submitted data that was not imported from\nthe IRS.\nFAFSA Partner Portal or EDE. An FAA can submit corrections to a student9s application data using the FAFSA Partner\nPortal. Your school can submit corrections and updates electronically by entering the data manually in the FAFSA Partner\nPortal or by transmitting it to the FAFSA Processing System. However, you cannot update an applicant9s or contributor9s\npersonally identifiable information (PII) or consent and approval using EDE, a third-party software, or the FAFSA Partner\nPortal.\nIf your school isn9t listed on the transaction you want to correct, the student must provide you with the DRN printed on the\nFAFSA Submission Summary. You can then add your school in the next available institution field and gain electronic\naccess to the resulting corrected transaction. If all the fields are filled, the student must add your school code using the\nFAFSA online.\nCorrections and updates sent by a school must be based on reliable documentation in its possession that supports the\nchanges to applicant data or signed documentation from the student or contributor. Examples of reliable documentation\ninclude applications for admission, acceptance letters, course registration information, or academic transcripts. Examples\nof signed documentation from a student or contributor on which corrections and updates may be based include a FAFSA\nSubmission Summary, a copy of the correction or update, student/contributor statement, verification documents, or\ncopies of tax returns or transcripts. These do not have to be wet signatures.\nThe FPS will process the change, send an ISIR to the school, and send the student an updated FAFSA Submission\nNote: Batch corrections and updates may not be available at the time you need to begin making such corrections\nor updates. However, these instructions are provided for future use when this functionality becomes available.\nNote: Some student-initiated corrections have been flagged incorrectly as school-initiated corrections on the\nresulting ISIR transaction. The Department is aware of this defect and working to find a resolution. If your school is\naware of a transaction that is flagged incorrectly as a school-initiated correction, you should notate the student9s\nfile. You are not required to collect documentation unless you have conflicting information or reason to believe the\ninformation on the ISIR transaction is incorrect.",
        "reconcile the conflicting information and take appropriate action under the specific program requirements (depending on\nthe outcome, funds may have to be returned).\nSubsequent ISIRs\nYou are generally required to review all subsequent transactions for a student for the entire processing year even if you\nverified an earlier transaction. An exception to this requirement is if a later transaction comes in after the student is no\nlonger enrolled at your institution. Review the SAI, C flag, or verification tracking group for changes. Review new\ncomments or NSLDS information that impacts eligibility for aid. Check any updates or corrections. If the SAI has not\nchanged and there are no changes in the C flag, verification tracking group, or NSLDS information, no action is generally\nrequired. If the SAI does change but it either doesn9t affect the amount and type of aid received or the data elements that\nchanged were already verified, no action is required. But if the SAI changes and the pertinent data elements were not\nverified, then you must investigate. Of course, any time the C flag changes or NSLDS data have been modified, you must\nresolve any conflicts.\nDiscrepant Tax Data\nFinancial aid administrators do not need to be tax experts, but there are some issues that even a layperson with basic tax\nlaw information can evaluate. Because conflicting data often involve such information, FAAs must have a fundamental\nunderstanding of relevant tax issues that can impact the need analysis. You are obligated to know (1) whether a person\nwas required to file a tax return and (2) what the correct filing status for a person should be. The IRS9s online Interactive\nTax Assistant can help with these and other issues by walking the user through a series of questions. IRS Publication 17 is\nalso a useful resource.\nResolution of Conflicting Information\nYou must resolve conflicting information prior to disbursing aid to a student enrolled at your school. Even if the conflict\nconcerns a previous award year, you must still investigate it. You have resolved the matter when you have\ndetermined which data are correct; this might simply be confirming that an earlier determination was the right one. You\nmust document your findings and include an explanation that justifies your decision.\nThe verification page on the FSA Assessments site has guidance to help you review your conflicting information\nprocedures; see Activity 1.\nReferral of Fraud Cases\nRequirement to Verify Questionable Data\n34 CFR 668.54(a)(2)\nDiscrepant Tax Data Example\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 7: An FAA notices that a dependent student9s parents, who are married and live\ntogether, have each filed as head of household (which offers a greater tax deduction than filing as single or\nmarried). The FAA must ask if that is the right status. Resolution of the conflict could be the parents refiling and\nsubmitting a copy of the amended return or a reasonable explanation of why there is no conflict under IRS rules.",
        "Chapter 1\nThe Application Process: FAFSA to ISIR\nThe laws governing the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs require that a person apply for aid with a form provided by\nthe U.S. Department of Education (ED, Department) and that no fee be charged for processing it. This form is the Free\nApplication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form.\nTo be considered for federal student aid, a student must complete a FAFSA form. It collects financial and other information\nused to calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI; formerly Expected Family Contribution or EFC) and to determine a student9s\neligibility through computer matches with other agencies.\nThe FAFSA form is the only application students must complete to apply for Title IV aid. A school cannot require extra\ninformation from students to package Title IV aid, except for verification, resolution of conflicting information, or\nprofessional judgment determinations. However, a school may require additional information for other purposes, such as\npackaging private or institutional aid. If the school collects additional information that affects Title IV eligibility, it must\ntake the information into account when awarding Title IV aid.\nTypes of FAFSA Applications\nMore than 99% of FAFSA forms are filed electronically. However, there are other options for individuals unwilling or unable\nto file electronically.\nFAFSA Online\nImplementation of the FAFSA Simplification Act and the FUTURE Act required a complete overhaul of the FAFSA form,\nbeginning with the 2024-25 award year. Submitted FAFSA forms are sent directly to the FAFSA Processing System (FPS).\nHelp is available for students online or by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-4-FED-AID\n(1-800-433-3243).\nThere are many advantages to filing electronically, including:\nFaster processing;\nAvailability of online help;\nSkip logic, which allows applicants to skip over questions that don9t pertain to them; and\nFewer errors and rejected applications because internal and end-of-entry data edits ensure that required fields are\ncompleted and conflicts are resolved prior to submission.\nPaper (PDF) FAFSA Form\nThe paper (PDF) FAFSA form is available on StudentAid.gov. In future cycles, students will also be able to call the Federal\nStudent Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-433-3243 to request a single copy.\nThe form can be printed and completed by hand, or by typing the data on the PDF before printing and mailing it. The\nmailing address is printed on the first page of the FAFSA form under <Mail Your FAFSA® Form=. The address changes\nannually, so use the address printed on the associated year9s FAFSA form.\nYou must mail all fillable pages of the form (pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to\nthe applicant. Extra postage will be required due to the size and/or weight of the mailing.\nFSA no longer prints or mails aid-related publications, though they are available on StudentAid.gov for users to download\nand print.\nIncarcerated Applicants\nIncarcerated applicants who have access to the necessary technology can complete a FAFSA form online using their\nStudentAid.gov account username and password. However, many incarcerated applicants will not be able to file",
        "2. The disclosure of their FTI by the IRS to the Department;\n3. The use of their FTI by a Department official to determine an applicant9s eligibility for federal student aid and the\namount for which they are eligible; and\n4. The redisclosure of FTI by the Department to an eligible institution, state higher education agency, or a designated\nscholarship organization (e.g., institutional or state financial aid).\nOnly the Department has the authority to obtain approval and consent for the use and disclosure of FTI for such purposes.\nOur partners (FAAs, advocates, etc.) are not permitted to obtain approval and consent on behalf of FAFSA contributors\n(including parent(s) or spouse) for the use and disclosure of FTI.\nOnce a FAFSA contributor has provided consent and approval for use and disclosure of FTI for a FAFSA cycle (e.g., the\n2025-26 FAFSA cycle), they cannot revoke consent for that cycle. The ability to revoke consent is not needed for FAFSA\npurposes because the FAFSA contributor is providing a one-time consent for a specific tax year and an annual consent is\nrequired for each FAFSA cycle.\nStudents and contributors are not able to view or edit the imported FTI data. This is to enhance security, privacy, and to\nreduce the risk of the misuse of sensitive data. However, you (the financial aid administrator) will be able to see the\ntransferred data on the ISIR. Schools and other partners that receive ISIRs must protect federal student aid information\nprovided to them by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the application, award, and administration of the\nfederal student aid programs as permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA, as amended. In keeping with the\nexpectation that you protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, you must not disclose FTI\nfrom the FAFSA form unless the disclosure and use is permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA 1098h. For additional\ninformation and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34.\nSignatures\nEach student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS\nand (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per\napplication cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a\nprocessed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is\naccurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction\nto contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating\nthat the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their\nFAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect\nthe necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature\nrequirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval. Only the Department can collect a contributor9s\nconsent and approval.\nFederal Tax Information\nThe following data received by the Department from the IRS are considered FTI:\nTax Year (ex. Award year 2025-26 is based on 2023 tax year information from the IRS)\nTax Filing Status\nAdjusted Gross Income (AGI)\nNumber of Exemptions and Number of Dependents\nIncome Earned from Work\nTaxes Paid\nEducational Credits\nUntaxed IRA distributions\nIRA deductions and payments\nTax exempt interest\nUntaxed pension amounts\nSchedule C net profit/loss",
        "Deadlines\nThe application processing cycle typically lasts 21 months, with the FAFSA form opening on October 1 in the year prior to\nthe start of the award year. For the 2025-26 application cycle, the online FAFSA opened for beta testing to a limited\npopulation of applicants on October 1, with the form expected to be available to all applicants by December 1, 2024.\nApplications will be accepted through June 30, 2026.\nThe FPS must receive a student9s online FAFSA information by June 30, 2026. A paper FAFSA form must be legible, and it\nmust be mailed to the Federal Student Aid Programs address listed on the FAFSA form in time for the processor to receive\nit by June 30, 2026. There are no exceptions to these deadlines. An online application received after June 30, 2026, will\nnot be processed.\nA paper application received before the application opens for the award year, or after June 30, 2026, will be returned\nunprocessed with a letter of explanation. If it is signed before and received after the application opens for the award year,\nit will be accepted but the student will receive a rejected FAFSA Submission Summary asking them to date and re-sign the\nFAFSA Submission Summary and return it for processing.\nFor other deadlines pertaining to corrections, changes, disbursements, and verification, see the official deadline notice for\nthe 2025-26 award year. It will provide all the processing deadline dates and will be available in the Knowledge Center\nunder <Federal Registers.= For these deadlines, the date the FPS processed the ISIR transaction is the date the institution\nreceived the ISIR. The processed date is displayed above the SAI on the first page of the FAFSA Submission Summary and\nISIR printout.\nStudents who submit the FAFSA form later in the award year can receive aid for the entire year, including completed\npayment periods, if they were not ineligible at the time. See the section on retroactive disbursements for completed\nperiods in Volume 4, Chapter 2 of the FSA Handbook.\nWebsites for students\nhttps://studentaid.gov/4Higher education portal that contains resources and information about paying for\ncollege. The site includes access to the FAFSA application, loan information, counseling, repayment, and other\ntools to help future, current, and former students access financial aid.\nhttps://studentaid.gov/fafsa4Submit a FAFSA application or make corrections to a previously submitted\napplication; get an online FAFSA Submission Summary; check status of an application.\nhttps://studentaid.gov/aid-estimator/4The Federal Student Aid Estimator can help applicants understand\ntheir options to pay for college or career school by providing an early estimate of the SAI and eligibility for federal\nstudent aid.\nhttps://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch4Create an account username and password, which\nallows students, FAFSA contributors, and other borrowers access to the StudentAid.gov portal.\nhttps://studentaid.gov/fafsa-apply/parents4Who counts as a parent on the FAFSA form? This tool helps\ndetermine which parent(s) should participate in a student9s FAFSA form.\nResources for schools\n2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide 3 This guide consolidates all FAFSA-related processing information and\nguidance into a multi-volume resource. It includes the following volumes and replaces previous stand-alone\nguides:\nVolume 1 3 Summary of Changes (PDF)\nVolume 2 3 FPS Schedule and Getting Help (PDF)\nVolume 3 3 Electronic Data Exchange and FAFSA Processing (PDF)"

      "question": "How is the definition of a parent on the FAFSA relevant to the completion of the form for students with unmarried biological parents living together?",
      "response": "The definition of a parent on the FAFSA is highly relevant for students with unmarried biological parents living together. According to the guidance, when parents are divorced or never married and not living together, the parent whose financial support provided more than 50% of the student's support during the last 12 months should be reported as the parent on the FAFSA. This means that even if the student lives with or receives support from the other biological parent, the parent who contributed the greater share of financial support is the one whose information is necessary for completing the form.\n\nIf neither parent provided more than 50% support, then the parent with the greater income and assets should be reported. In cases where support was equally split or support is minimal, the parent with the higher income and assets takes precedence.\n\nThis definition ensures that the FAFSA accurately reflects the student's primary financial support source, which is crucial for determining dependency status and financial aid eligibility. It also clarifies that a stepparent who has not adopted the student is not considered a parent for FAFSA purposes, even if they are married to the biological parent or living with them.\n\nIn summary, for students with unmarried biological parents living together, the FAFSA uses the parent who provided more than half of the student's support during the last year as the relevant parent. If support was less than 50%, then the parent with the higher income and assets is reported. This approach helps establish who should be the parent contributor on the FAFSA and ensures the financial information is accurate for aid calculation.",

        "However, a stepparent who did not adopt the student cannot be the sole parent for determining dependency status. If one\nparent dies, the student is still a dependent of the remaining biological or adoptive parent, not the stepparent.\nIf parents are divorced or never married and not living together, the parent on the FAFSA form should be the parent who\nprovided more than 50% of the financial support for the student during the last 12 months. This may be different from the\nparent the student lived with during that same period. If one parent pays child support and/or alimony to the other parent,\nthe amount paid counts for the payer when determining which parent provided more than 50% of the student9s financial\nsupport and is a required contributor on the FAFSA form. Once the parent who provides more than 50% of the financial\nsupport for the student has been determined, that parent (and their current spouse, if applicable) should report their\nfinancial information on the student9s FAFSA form as a contributor.\nIf neither parent provided more than 50% of the financial support for the student (including when neither parent provided\nsupport for the student) during the last 12 months, the parent with the greater income and assets is a required\ncontributor on the FAFSA form. Once the parent with the greater income and assets has been determined, that parent\n(and their current spouse, if applicable) should report their financial information on the student9s FAFSA form.\nNote: It is not typical that a student will receive support from both parents exactly equally. Usually, you can determine\nthat the student received more than half support from one of the parents.\nA foster parent or a legal guardian is not treated as a parent for Title IV purposes. If at any time since the age of 13 both\nstudent9s parents were dead (and they did not have an adoptive parent at that time) or the student was in foster care,\nthey are independent. If the student is now or was when they became an adult an emancipated minor or in legal\nguardianship, the student is independent.\nIf a student is living with their grandparents or other relatives, their data should not be reported on the FAFSA form as\nparental data unless they have adopted the student.\nParent Identity Information (30)\nLike the student, the parent identity information should match what appears on their social security card. If the parent\nSurviving Parent and Stepparent Example\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 9: A dependent student9s parents divorced when the student was five years old. The\nstudent9s mother remarried, and the student lived with her and the student9s stepfather, who did not adopt the\nstudent. The student9s mother died last year, but the student9s biological father is still living. The student does not\nmeet any of the criteria to be independent. Because the student9s biological father is the only surviving parent,\nthe student needs to report the biological father9s information on the FAFSA form, even if the student is still living\nwith and being supported by the stepfather.\nStudent Living With Relatives Example\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 10: A student9s father is dead, and the student9s mother can9t support the student,\nso the student is living with their grandparents. The student9s mother doesn9t pay any money for the student9s\nsupport. The student doesn9t meet any of the independence criteria, so the student must provide parental\ninformation. Because the student9s grandparents haven9t adopted the student, they are not the student9s parents.\nThe student will have to provide information about their mother on the form unless there are unusual\ncircumstances that would warrant a dependency override or the student may elect to receive only unsubsidized\nloans. See Chapter 5 for additional guidance on unusual circumstances.",
        "Orphan, Ward of the Court, or in Foster Care\nA student who is an orphan 3 both parents are dead 3 when 13 or older is independent even if the student has\nsubsequently been adopted. Likewise, a student who was, at any time since the age of 13, in foster care or a ward of\nthe court is independent even if their status changed later.\nA student is a ward of the court if a court has assumed legal custody of the student. In some states the court may impose\nits authority over a juvenile who remains in the legal custody of their parents; such a student is not a ward of the court.\nAlso, incarceration of a student does not qualify the student as a ward of the court. In some states the phrase <ward of the\nstate= is used; if it is not due to incarceration, this is considered the same as a ward of the court for dependency status.\nIf an institution requires that a student provide documentation that they were in foster care at age 13 or older, you must\nconsider any of the following documentation to be adequate:\nproviding more than half of the sibling9s support. Therefore, the student won9t be able to include the sibling in\ntheir family size. Additionally, the student may or may not be independent, depending on their responses to other\ndependency questions.\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 3: A student is appointed legal guardian of their minor cousin, who lives with the\nstudent. The cousin receives Social Security benefits, which are paid to the student since the cousin is a minor.\nThese benefits provide more than half of the cousin9s support. Because the cousin lives with and is supported by\nthe student (through the Social Security benefits) throughout the award year, the student indicates they have a\nlegal dependent on the FAFSA form and is an independent student. However, if the cousin did not live with the\nstudent, the student can't indicate they have a legal dependent and would only be independent if they meet other\nindependent circumstances.\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 4: A student and their partner live together but are not married. The student pays\n$1,500 per month to support their partner. The partner also has earned income of $2,000 per month and receives\n$200 per month from their parents. The partner uses all of this for their support. The student cannot consider their\npartner a legal dependent since the $1,500 they provide is not more than half of the partner9s total support of\n$3,700.\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 5: In April 2025, a student applies for aid for both 2024-25 and 2025-26 award years.\nOne month prior to that, their parent moved in with the student. The parent is undocumented and does not work\nor qualify to receive other federal benefits. Even though the student provides all their parent9s support, the\nmonths of support for March through June 2025 (the end of the 2024-25 award year) would not be more than 50%\nfor 2024-25 award year. Therefore, the student cannot claim their parent as a legal dependent on their 2024-25\nFAFSA form. If the parent had moved in before the midpoint of the year, the student would have been able to\ncount the parent as a dependent for 2024-25. However, because the two plan to live together and the student\nplans to provide more than 50% support at least through June 2026, the student can count the parent as a\ndependent for 2025-26.\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 6: A student lives alone with their infant child. The infant child9s other parent pays\n$200 per month in child support to the student. The student also receives the equivalent of $500 per month from\ngovernment assistance programs for the child. The student provides the remainder of the child9s support through\npart-time work. The student can consider the child a legal dependent as they live together and the student\nprovides more than 50% of the child9s support.\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 7: A student lives alone with their infant child. The child9s other parent shares\ncustody of the child and pays $1,000 per month in child support to the student. The student receives the\nequivalent of $500 per month from government assistance programs for the child. The student does not work and\nrelies on the child support and government assistance to support the child. The student cannot consider the child\na legal dependent, even though the child lives with the student, because the student does not provide more than\n50% of the child9s support. If the student is not otherwise independent, the student will need to provide parent\ninformation on the FAFSA form. If the child9s other parent is also a student, they could consider the child a legal\ndependent on their FAFSA form if the child lived with them and they provide more than 50% of the child9s support.",
        "This question asks if a 2023 IRS Form 1040 or 1040-NR was (or will be) completed. It also asks about income earned in a\nforeign country or if the student spouse filed a tax return in a U.S. territory. See the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)=\nquestion for additional information.\nStudent Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28)\nThis information comes directly from the student spouse9s 2023 tax return. See the discussion of tax return data in the\n<Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX or be\nmanually entered by the student spouse. Unlike the student, the student9s spouse will not be asked to report taxable\ncollege grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits. If the student or spouse had an amount to report, the student should\nhave reported the joint total in the student section. The spouse will also not be asked about receipt of the earned income\ntax credit (EITC). Receipt of the EITC is used to determine if the student (or parent) is a single parent. If the student (or\nparent) is married, they are not a single parent, which makes it unnecessary to ask the spouse about the EITC.\nStudent Spouse Consent, Approval, and Signature (29)\nEvery student spouse contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The student spouse contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the\nIRS.\nApproval 3 The student spouse contributor must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may\nreceive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The student spouse contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their signature on the\nonline FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nMarried, independent students who did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete\nFAFSA ready for submission. The student will receive an email confirmation that the form was submitted. The spouse will\nsee an abbreviated confirmation that the form is complete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide\nan email address will receive email notification when their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA\nSubmission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission\nSummary.\nContributor: Parent\nThis section consists of 12 questions related to the parent of a dependent student.\nDependent students will always have at least one parent contributor. If the student is completing the FAFSA form online,\nthey will be prompted to enter their parent9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and email\naddress) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The parent will be notified by email that they have been invited\nto contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The parent should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and\npassword to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s parent is married\nand filed their 2023 taxes jointly with their current spouse, only one parent contributor is required. If the student9s parent\nis either (1) married or remarried, or (2) unmarried and living together, and did not file their 2023 taxes jointly with their\ncurrent spouse or partner, the parent9s spouse or partner will be a required contributor on the student9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent complete the parent section.\nWho Counts as a Parent on the FAFSA?\nIn most cases, it9s clear who the parents are. A parent is a biological or adoptive parent, or a person that the state has\ndetermined to be a parent (for example, when a state allows another person9s name to be listed as a parent on a birth\ncertificate). A stepparent is considered a parent if married to a biological or adoptive parent and if the student counts\nthem in their family size. Biological and adoptive parents who are unmarried and living together select that as their\nmarital status, and both report their information on the FAFSA form.",
        "veteran, or will be one by June 30, 2026. Students should provide the financial aid office at their school a copy of their\nDD214 (the Certificate of Release or Discharge from active duty, with <Character of Service= as anything but\n<dishonorable=). If it shows that the student is a veteran, they can receive aid as an independent student. If a National\nGuard member or a reservist who served on active duty (for other than training) did not receive a DD214 but can obtain a\nletter from a superior officer that documents the call-up to active duty and that classifies the character of service as\nanything but <dishonorable,= the student will be considered a veteran for FSA purposes. If the VA match problem is due to\nan error in the VA9s database, the student should contact the VA and correct the error. Once the error is corrected, you\nmay request to resend the application to agency matches on the FAFSA Partner Portal. A subsequent transaction will then\nreprocess the match with the VA.\nIf the student is not a veteran and will not be one by June 30, 2026, they must correct their answer to Question 5 and\ninvite at least one parent to contribute to their FAFSA form.\nChildren and Legal Dependents\nStudents who have legal dependents are independent. Legal dependents include children or other people (except a\nspouse) who meet all the following criteria:\nThey live with the student (or, in the case of children, live apart from the student due to a qualifying temporary\nabsence under IRS code, such as living apart due to college enrollment).\nThey currently receive more than half of their support from the student.\nThey will continue to receive more than half of their support from the student between July 1, 2025, and June 30,\n2026\nIf one or both of a student9s parents are directly or indirectly providing more than 50% support in cash or other assistance\nto the student9s child, then the student could not claim to have a legal dependent who receives more than half of their\nsupport from the student. <Indirect support= includes support that a parent gives to the student on behalf of the child. If\nthe student is living with a parent who is paying for most of the household expenses, the parent would usually be\nconsidered the primary source of support to the student9s child, and the student should not indicate they have legal\ndependents. However, there may be some cases where the student can demonstrate that they provide more than half of\ntheir child9s support even while living at home with their parents, in which case the student could indicate they have legal\ndependents.\nIf the student receives money or other support for the legal dependent from sources other than their parents, the student\nmay count it as part of their support to the child. Sources include government programs, such as Temporary Assistance\nfor Needy Families (TANF) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), that provide benefits for dependent\nchildren. So, a student may be considered independent when the benefit they receive is the primary support for the child.\nHowever, child support received from a noncustodial parent cannot be counted as part of the student9s support to the\nchild.\nWhen a student completes a FAFSA form after the award year has begun and indicates they have a legal dependent who\nis not the student9s child, the support already given by the student during the award year plus the future support for the\nremainder of the award year must total more than 50% for the whole award year for the individual to meet the definition\nof a legal dependent.\nLegal Dependent Examples\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 1: A student and their disabled sibling currently live together. The sibling receives a\nsmall disability payment each month, but the student provides more than 50% support for the sibling and expects\nto continue to do so through the award year. The sibling is considered a dependent of the student and can be\nincluded in the student9s family size on the FAFSA form. The student is also an independent student due to having\na legal dependent.\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 2: The same student and disabled sibling currently live together and expect to\ncontinue to do so through the award year. The sibling receives a small disability payment AND a pension payment\neach month. The combination of the pension and the disability payment will be enough that the student won9t be",

Instead, these individuals will be asked if their family size is different from the number of individuals claimed on their\ntax return. If they indicate there was a change, they will be asked to manually report their number of dependents in a\nfollow-up question.\nOn the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, family size appears in both the student and parent contributor sections. Dependent\nstudents are instructed to skip Question 9 on the paper (PDF) FAFSA form. Dependent students completing the online\nFAFSA form will not see the family size question in the student section.\nThe following persons are included in the family size of an independent student:\nThe student and their spouse, unless the spouse has died or is not living in the household due to separation or\ndivorce.\nThe student9s dependent children, if they live with the student (or live apart from the student due to a qualifying\ntemporary absence under IRS code, such as living apart due to college enrollment) and will receive more than half of\ntheir support from the student (and spouse) from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026.

Schools can use the information provided to perform a special circumstance adjustment\nfor a student. See <Professional Judgment= in Chapter 5 of this volume for additional information.\nThe student is always included in the number in college. Also included are those in the family size who are or will be\nenrolled at least half time during the award year in a degree or certificate program at a Title IV-eligible school.\nStudent Demographic Information (11) and Student Race and Ethnicity (12)\nThese questions collect sex/gender and race/ethnicity information about the student. The answers to these questions will\nnot affect the student9s eligibility for federal student aid, be used in any calculations, or be shared with the schools to\nwhich the student applies. They will be used for research purposes only.\nStudent Citizenship (13)\nFamily Size Example\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 8: A married student recently separated from their spouse, and they are no longer\nliving together. They have a child together who is currently living with the student9s spouse. The student is paying\nchild support to the spouse, but it isn9t enough to provide more than half the child9s support. The spouse and child\ncannot be included in the student9s family size, even though the student and spouse are not yet legally divorced.\nHowever, the student9s nephew lives with the student and receives more than half of their support from the\nstudent (and will do so for the award year).

In fact, the Department\nencourages you to use the flexibility in the law to presume a student with a dependency override is independent in\nsubsequent years unless the student tells you their situation has changed, or you have conflicting information. Though\ninstitutions can ask students if their unusual circumstances or homeless situation has changed each year, they should not\nmaintain a practice that delays or hinders financial aid for such a student, nor may they require the student to answer\nprior to packaging or disbursing aid or require the student to submit additional documentation unless there is conflicting\ninformation that the institution needs to resolve.\nTo override the student9s dependent status on an initial application through the FAFSA Partner Portal, the FAA should use\nthe Dependency Override code of <1= (see Volume 4A of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide for more information).\nTo authorize a dependency override on a paper FAFSA form, the FAA marks the bubble for an override, labeled <D/O,= in\nthe <College Use Only= area, fills in the school9s federal code, and signs. A separate letter attached to the application in\nlieu of making the override is not acceptable.\nIf the student has already submitted a FAFSA form, you can use the FAFSA Partner Portal to authorize or cancel an\noverride; overrides cannot be done on the FAFSA Submission Summary. If a student had an override done at another\nschool in the current year, that will be noted with the school9s federal code on the FAFSA Partner Portal. Only the school\nperforming the override will receive that transaction. If the student adds your school to the transaction or gives you their\ndata release number (DRN), you can access the record.\nDependency Override Example\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 5: A student is a refugee from Ukraine who qualifies for federal student aid as an\neligible noncitizen. The student9s FAFSA form was rejected because the student is a dependent student and did\nnot provide data for their parents. When the aid administrator asks the student for their parents9 information, the\nstudent says their parents are in Ukraine and have been displaced due to the upheaval there. The student doesn9t\nknow how to contact them. The FAA asks the student for documentation and the student says they have a relative\nliving in the U.S. who can confirm the situation. The FAA, per institutional policy, asks for the relative to either\nappear in person and sign a statement confirming the student9s account or to send the aid office a notarized\nstatement. The relative, who works not far from the school, comes to the aid office, signs the statement, and the\nFAA grants the student a dependency override.",

A student may indicate that they have an unusual circumstance\nby selecting <Yes= to Question 7 on the FAFSA form. The student may then skip the parent sections of the form. Students\nwho select <Yes= to this question will be given provisional independent student status and directed to provide\ndocumentation to their financial aid office for determination. (See <Unusual Circumstances= in Chapter 5.)\nActive Duty in the U.S. Armed Forces\nNote: The FAFSA Simplification Act required ED to limit or eliminate unnecessary questions from the FAFSA form.\nIf the answer to a question is not necessary to determine a student9s eligibility for federal student aid or if the\nanswer is available or derivable from answers to other questions, the Department is not permitted to require the\nstudent to provide an answer.\nFor example, when completing the FAFSA form online, applicants are only asked if they have children or\ndependents other than a spouse if they are under the age of 24. A student aged 24 or older will not have the\nopportunity to answer this question as they are independent by age, making this question unnecessary. In FPP,\nthe answer to this question will be <Blank=; on the student9s ISIR, the answer to this question will be <No=.\nTherefore, you should not assume that a <Blank= or <No= indicates the student does not have children or other\ndependents. It is possible for an applicant to have a <No= or <Blank= response to this question and report a family\nsize that appears to include dependents other than a spouse. This is not, on its own, conflicting information.\nIndependent Student Determination\nHEA Sec. 480(d)",
        "However, there will be instances where manual entry of tax information will be necessary.\nThis information comes directly from the 2023 federal tax return of the parent9s (and parent9s spouse if married and filed\njointly with their current spouse). See the discussion of tax return data in the <Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)=\nquestion for a list of data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX or be manually entered by the parent.\nAnnual Child Support Received (39)\nAnnual child support received is included as an asset of the recipient in the SAI formula. If a dependent student9s parent\n(and their spouse or partner) received child support in the last complete calendar year, they should enter the total\namount received for all children in the family size in this question.\nParent Assets (40)\nAn asset is property that the family owns and has an exchange value. The FAFSA form collects current data (as of the day\nof signing the FAFSA form) about cash, savings, and checking accounts; investments; real estate; businesses; and\ninvestment farms. See the <Student Assets (22)= question for additional discussion of assets.\nParent Consent, Approval, and Signature (41)\nEvery parent contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The parent contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the IRS.\nApproval 3 The parent contributor must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may receive,\nuse, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The parent contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their signature on the online\nFAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nA dependent student with a single parent now has a complete FAFSA ready for submission. A dependent student with\nmarried parents who filed their 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse will need to provide the parent9s spouse9s\nidentity and contact information. If all required information is provided and the FAFSA form is submitted, the student will\nreceive an email confirmation. The parent will see an abbreviated confirmation, letting them know that the form is\ncomplete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide an email address will receive email notification\nwhen their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who do not provide\nan email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nContributor: Parent Spouse or Partner\nThis section consists of five questions related to the spouse or partner of a parent of a dependent student. If the student9s\nparent is married, the spouse9s information is always required on the FAFSA form. If the student9s parent is unmarried and\nliving with a partner, the partner9s information is only required on the FAFSA form if the partner is also the student9s legal\nparent.\nThe parent spouse or partner is only a required contributor on the FAFSA form if the parent is either (1) married or\nremarried and did not file taxes jointly with their current spouse in 2023, or (2) unmarried and living with the student9s\nother legal parent. If the parent contributor is completing the FAFSA form online and the parent9s spouse is identified as a\nrequired contributor, the parent will be prompted to enter the parent spouse9s or partner9s identity information (name,\nSocial Security number, date of birth, and email address) to invite them to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The\nparent spouse or partner will be notified by email that they have been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form.\nThe spouse or partner should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and password to access the student9s\nFAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the parent9s spouse is not a required contributor, the parent will\nenter the same identifying information and email address, but the parent9s spouse will not be invited to contribute to the\nstudent9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent9s spouse or partner complete the",
        "unusual circumstances by publicly posting the option on their website.\nAn FAA may conduct dependency overrides on a case-by-case basis for students with unusual circumstances. An aid\nadministrator may override only from dependent to independent. If the FAA determines that an override is appropriate,\nthey must maintain the determination with any supporting documentation.\nUnder HEA Sec. 480(d)(9), the FAFSA Simplification Act incorporated additional unusual circumstances to consider when a\nstudent is unable to contact a parent or where contact with parents poses a risk to such student.\nUnusual circumstances do include (but are not limited to):\nHuman trafficking, as described in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.);\nLegally granted refugee or asylum status;\nParental abandonment or estrangement; or\nStudent or parental incarceration.\nIn such cases an override might be warranted based upon the student9s individual circumstances. These conditions would\nalso not disqualify a student from being a homeless unaccompanied youth or self-supporting and at risk of homelessness.\nHowever, none of the conditions listed below, singly or in combination, qualify as unusual circumstances meriting a\ndependency override.\nUnusual circumstances do not include:\nParents refuse to contribute to the student9s education.\nParents will not provide information for the FAFSA or verification.\nParents do not claim the student as a dependent for income tax purposes.\nStudent demonstrates total self-sufficiency.\nAdditionally, the FAFSA Simplification Act introduced new requirements for processing and communicating with students\nwho request an adjustment for unusual circumstances. Schools and financial aid administrators must:\nNotify students of the school9s process, requirements, and reasonable timeline to review adjustment requests after\ntheir FAFSA form is submitted;\nProvide students with a final determination of their dependency status and financial aid offer as soon as practicable\nafter reviewing all requested documentation;\nRetain all documentation, including documented interviews, related to the adjustment for at least three years after\nthe student9s last term of enrollment; and\nPresume that any student who has obtained an adjustment for unusual circumstances and a final determination of\nindependence to be independent for each subsequent award year at the same institution unless--\nThe student informs the institution that their circumstances have changed; or\nThe institution has conflicting information about the student9s independence.\nDocumentation is critical 3 schools must ensure that any supporting documentation they collect is adequate to\nsubstantiate the student9s circumstances. Documentation may include (but is not limited to) the following:\na documented interview between the student and the financial aid administrator;\nsubmission of a court order or official federal or state documentation that the student or student9s parents or legal\nDependency Overrides\nHEA Sec. 479A(c) and 480(d)(9)\nGEN-22-15.",
        "parent spouse or partner contributor section.\nParent Spouse or Partner Identity Information (42)\nLike the student, the parent spouse or partner identity information should match what appears on their social security\ncard. If the parent spouse or partner does not have a Social Security number and is completing their section of the form\nonline, the SSN field will automatically be blank based on the information in their StudentAid.gov account. If the parent\nspouse is completing their section using the paper (PDF) FAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field. In both\napplication methods, the parent should enter their ITIN, if they have one, in the ITIN field.\nParent Spouse or Partner Contact Information (43)\nThis is the parent spouse9s or partner9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address.\nParent Spouse or Partner Tax Filing Status (44)\nThis question asks if the parent spouse or partner filed (or will file) a 2023 IRS 1040 or 1040-NR. It also asks about income\nearned in a foreign country or if the parent spouse or partner filed a tax return in a U.S. territory. See the discussion of tax\nreturn data in the <Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the\nFA-DDX or be manually entered by the parent spouse or partner.\nParent Spouse or Partner 2023 Tax Return Information (45)\nThis information comes directly from the parent spouse9s or partner9s 2023 federal tax return. See the discussion of tax\nreturn data in the <Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the\nFA-DDX or be manually entered by the parent spouse or partner. Unlike the parent, the parent spouse or partner will not\nbe asked to report either (1) taxable college grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits, or (2) receipt of the earned\nincome credit. See <Student Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28)= for further explanation of these two excluded\nelements.\nParent Spouse or Partner Consent, Approval, and Signature (46)\nEvery parent spouse or partner contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The parent spouse or partner contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information\nto the IRS.\nApproval 3 The parent spouse or partner must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may\nreceive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The parent spouse or partner contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their\nsignature on the online FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nA dependent student with (1) unmarried parents living together or (2) a married or remarried parent who did not file their\n2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete FAFSA form ready for processing. The student will\nreceive an email confirmation that their FAFSA form is complete. The parent spouse or partner will see an abbreviated\nconfirmation that the form is complete, and that the student has been notified. If the applicant provided an email address,\nthey will receive an email when the FAFSA form is processed with instructions for accessing their FAFSA Submission\nSummary. Applicants without an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nRole: Preparer\nIf someone other than the student, student spouse, parent, or parent spouse or partner completed a portion of the FAFSA\nform on the applicant9s behalf, that person must complete the Preparer section. Paid preparers are prohibited. This\nsection consists of three questions related to the unpaid preparer.",
        "Because the Department matches the student9s name and SSN with the Social Security Administration (SSA), the name on\nthe FAFSA form should match the one in the SSA9s records (i.e., as it appears on the student9s Social Security card).\nStudents (except citizens of one of the Freely Associated States 3 see <Account Username and Password= in Chapter 1)\nmust have an SSN to apply for federal student aid. If they submit a paper (PDF) FAFSA form without an SSN, the FAFSA\nform will be returned unprocessed. Students will be unable to submit a FAFSA form electronically without an account\nusername and password, which requires an SSN (except students who are citizens one of the Freely Associated States).\nThe student must contact the local SSA office to get an SSN or to find out what the number is if they lost their Social\nSecurity card. Go to https://www.ssa.gov/number-card for more information.\nIf the student9s name, date of birth, or SSN does not match with the Social Security Administration, the student typically\nneeds to resolve the issue with the SSA. If the information submitted is correct, the student must contact SSA to update\nits records. After the student receives confirmation that SSA has corrected its records, the student must contact the\nFederal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) and ask them to manually sync their data with SSA. Alternatively, if the\nstudent notifies the school that they received confirmation from SSA, the FAA may update the Resend to Matches field to\n<Y= in the FAFSA Partner Portal and submit it as a correction so the transaction can go back to SSA for an updated match\nflag. Records sent for rematching will continue to receive this match flag until SSA updates its database.\nStudents who enter their name, date of birth, or SSN incorrectly should log in to StudentAid.gov and update their\ninformation in Account Settings. The record will be resent to SSA for matching. Once SSA verifies the account, the\nstudent should update their FAFSA form by submitting a correction.\nStudent Contact Information (2)\nThis is the student9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address, with three exceptions:\nStudents under the age of 13 should not provide an email address as FSA cannot communicate with them\nelectronically. See <FAFSA Filers Under the Age of 13= in Chapter 1 for additional information.\nIncarcerated students should use an address where they can reliably receive mail. This may be the physical address\nof the facility they are in, the address of the school (if permitted by the school), or a central processing facility used\nby the facility for mail distribution. If a prison ID number is required by the facility for the applicant to receive mail,\nthe applicant should list that at the end of the address field. If an incarcerated student is released, they should also\nupdate their address in their StudentAid.gov account or on their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nHomeless students should use a mailing address where they can reliably receive mail. That can be the address of a\nrelative or friend who has given them permission to use it, or it can be their school9s address if they have contacted\nthe school for permission and instructions on how mail they receive at the school will reach them. As soon as\nhomeless students have more permanent housing, they should update their address in their StudentAid.gov account\nor on their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nIf the student provides an email address, they should get an email with a link to their online FAFSA Submission Summary\nwithin one to three days after the FPS receives the completed application. The Department will also use this email address\nto correspond with the student regarding their application.\nStudent Current Marital Status (3)\nThis is marital status <as of today= 3 the day the application is signed. Marital status cannot be projected. It can be\nupdated in limited circumstances; see Chapter 4.\nA student who is only engaged should select <single (never married)= unless they wait until after their marriage date to\ncomplete the FAFSA form. A student in a relationship that meets the criteria for common-law marriage in their state of\nlegal residence should select <married= and will be considered independent. A student who is separated from their spouse\nshould select <separated= and will be considered a dependent student for FAFSA purposes, unless they meet other criteria\nto be considered an independent student.\nStudent College or Career School Plans (4)\nStudents should answer this question based on the degree or certificate program they will be working on at the start of"

      "response": "The FAFSA form addresses situations where a student's parent has a unique tax filing status—such as not filing a U.S. tax return due to foreign income, working for international organizations, or filing in U.S. territories—by providing specific guidelines:\n\n- Parents or guardians who did not file a U.S. tax return and indicate reasons such as foreign income, foreign tax filing, or working for international organizations must manually input their income and tax information, converting foreign currency amounts to U.S. dollars.  \n- If a parent filed or will file a foreign tax return, or earned income abroad without filing a foreign return, they need to report their income manually because the FA-DDX system does not link to foreign tax authorities.  \n- Parents who live and work in U.S. territories but file taxes with local authorities rather than the IRS should answer \"No\" to the U.S. filing question and then select the appropriate reason (e.g., filed in a U.S. territory). They may need to manually enter their income information if the IRS data isn't available.  \n- For parents earning income in foreign countries but not filing a foreign return, they must report their income in U.S. dollars, including converting foreign currencies and entering amounts in the relevant sections.  \n- The form includes instructions for manual data entry and documentation review if conflicting or unusual circumstances are present.\n\nIn summary, when a parent has a nonstandard tax filing status—such as foreign income or filing solely in a U.S. territory—the FAFSA form prompts for manual entry of their financial information, and may require additional documentation to verify their reported income and circumstances.",

        "Received (18)= question for a list of these federal benefits.\nParent Tax Filing Status (37)\nThis question asks if the parent filed (or will file) a 2023 IRS 1040 or 1040-NR. If the answer is <no=, the parent will be\nasked to select one of the following reasons for not filing:\n1. The parent filed or will file a tax return with Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory.\n2. The parent filed or will file a foreign tax return.\n3. The parent either earned income in a foreign country but did not and will not file a foreign tax return, or worked for\nan international organization and was not required to report income on any tax return.\n4. The parent, even though they earned income in the U.S., did not and will not file a U.S. tax return because their\nincome was below the filing threshold.\n5. The parent did not and will not file a U.S. tax return for reasons other than low income.\n6. The parent did not and will not file any tax return because they did not earn any income or they were not required to\nfile under the Internal Revenue Code.\nThe purpose of these questions is to determine if a parent was either (1) required to file a 2023 U.S. federal tax return and\ndid not or (2) has income from a foreign country that must be manually entered on the FAFSA form.\nA dependent student will be automatically eligible for a Maximum Pell Grant if their parent (and parent9s spouse or\npartner) is subject to the U.S. Tax Code but is not required to file a 2023 U.S. federal tax return. The student will be\nassigned an SAI of -1,500 and will not be required to provide any further financial information on the FAFSA form.\nFinally, married parents are asked if they filed their 2023 tax return with their current spouse. Individuals who were\nmarried and filed jointly with the IRS and are no longer married to the spouse on the applicable tax return, or who have\nmarried a different spouse, will be required to manually enter their income and tax information. See the <Joint Return\nFilers Who Are No Longer Married= section in Chapter 4 for additional information on separating tax return and income\ninformation.\nIndividuals who only file foreign tax returns will also be unable to use the FA-DDX since it does not link to foreign tax\nauthorities. They will instead need to manually input their income and tax data by converting foreign currency to U.S.\ndollars and entering the resulting amounts in the comparable fields from U.S. tax returns. See the <Student Tax Filing\nStatus (19)= question for additional information.\nIf the parent indicates they earned income in a foreign country but did not file a foreign tax return, or worked for an\ninternational organization, such as the United Nations, World Bank, or International Monetary Fund (option 3), they will\nneed to manually input their income and tax data, similar to individuals who file foreign tax returns. See <Non-tax filers,\nforeign countries, and international organizations= under <Student Tax Filing Status (19)= for additional guidance.\nIf a parent indicates they did not file a U.S. tax return for reasons other than low income (option 5), you should treat this\nas conflicting information and request documentation to resolve it, which may include requiring the individual to file a tax\nreturn and present sufficient documentation of filing to you.\nIf a parent indicates they did not file any tax return because they did not earn any income (option 6) and their state of\nlegal residence is a foreign country, you must determine if the parent has foreign untaxed income that, when included in\nthe SAI calculation, impacts a student9s Pell Grant eligibility. Comment code 303 on the student9s ISIR should prompt you\nto request additional documentation. If your inquiry into the parents9 financial situation shows that the student might be\neligible for less or no Pell grant funds, you may use PJ to account for the parents9 untaxed income and assets, similar to\nthe action you might take when there is a substantial foreign earned income exclusion on a U.S. tax return that can affect\na student9s Pell eligibility.\nParent 2023 Tax Return Information (38)\nFor U.S. tax filers, much of the information in Question 38 will be transferred directly from the IRS via the FA-DDX.",
        "Dependent students who answer <no= to the first to parts of the question will still need to provide answers to questions\nabout their assets if their parents are required to provide financial information.\nIndependent students are automatically eligible for a Maximum Pell Grant if they (and their spouse, if married) are not\nrequired to file a 2023 federal tax return. Such students will be assigned an SAI of -1,500 and will not be required to\nprovide any further financial information on the FAFSA form.\nIndividuals who were married and filed jointly with the IRS and are no longer married to the spouse on the applicable tax\nreturn, and/or who have married a different spouse, will be required to manually enter their income and tax information.\nSee the <Joint Return Filers Who Are No Longer Married= section in Chapter 4 for additional information on separating tax\nreturn and income information.\nIndividuals who only file foreign tax returns will also be unable to use the FA-DDX since it does not link to foreign tax\nauthorities. They will instead need to manually input their income and tax data by converting foreign currency to U.S.\ndollars and entering the resulting amounts in the comparable fields from U.S. tax returns.\nPuerto Rico and Other U.S. Territory Residents\nSome individuals who reside in Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory may use an IRS Form 1040 or 1040-NR but file their\ntaxes with their local tax authority, not the IRS. These individuals should answer <No= to the question <Did or will the\nstudent file a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR?= and <Yes= to the subsequent question to indicate they filed a tax return\nwith Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory.\nAdditionally, some individuals who live and work in Puerto Rico may file two tax returns 3 one with the IRS and one with\nthe Puerto Rico tax authority. If they are filing electronically and FTI is available via the FA-DDX, only their tax information\nfiled with the IRS will be imported to the FAFSA form. They will not be able to manually enter the information from their\ntax return filed with Puerto Rico. If the FAA is aware of this dual filing scenario, the FAA should evaluate the applicant9s\ninformation and determine if the information from the Puerto Rico tax return should replace the information imported\nfrom the IRS. FAAs who determine that the information from the Puerto Rico tax return should be on the FAFSA should\nupdate the appropriate FAFSA fields and set the <Professional Judgment= indicator. While this is not a PJ, the changes to\nthe FAFSA application system require this work-around to override the IRS-transferred FTI with the manually updated FTI.\nFSA is working on system changes for future application cycles to allow for these updates without setting the <Professional\nJudgment= indicator. See Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-118 for additional information.\nNontax Filers, Foreign Countries, and International Organizations\nIn some countries the tax system does not operate as it does in the U.S., and people in those countries can earn a\nsubstantial amount of income and pay taxes without having to file a return. These individuals should answer <No= to the\nquestion <Did or will the student file a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR?= and <Yes= to the subsequent question to indicate\nthey earned income in a foreign country. While these individuals did not file taxes in the U.S., they are not eligible for an\nautomatic Maximum Pell Grant and must manually enter income and tax information.\nIn some instances, employees of certain international organizations, such as the United Nations, the International\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank, and others, might not be required to file a return. These individuals should answer <No=\nto the question <Did or will the student file a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR?= and <Yes= to the subsequent question to\nindicate they worked for an international organization. Like foreign non-filers described above, these individuals will be\nrequired to manually enter income and tax information, as they are not eligible to receive an automatic Maximum Pell\nGrant as a non-filer.\nIndividuals who earn income in a foreign country or as an employee of an international organization (e.g., World Bank,\nUnited Nations, and International Monetary Fund) and are not required to file a tax return should fill out the FAFSA form in\nthe following way using U.S. dollars:\nFor filing status, select <Single= if you9re single or <Married filing separately= if you9re married.\nFor AGI, include all wages, dividends, capital gains, business income, retirement distributions, and other income on\nwhich you may have paid taxes.\nFor income tax paid, include any income taxes you paid on income in your AGI.

        "This question asks if a 2023 IRS Form 1040 or 1040-NR was (or will be) completed. It also asks about income earned in a\nforeign country or if the student spouse filed a tax return in a U.S. territory. See the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)=\nquestion for additional information.\nStudent Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28)\nThis information comes directly from the student spouse9s 2023 tax return. See the discussion of tax return data in the\n<Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX or be\nmanually entered by the student spouse. Unlike the student, the student9s spouse will not be asked to report taxable\ncollege grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits. If the student or spouse had an amount to report, the student should\nhave reported the joint total in the student section. The spouse will also not be asked about receipt of the earned income\ntax credit (EITC). Receipt of the EITC is used to determine if the student (or parent) is a single parent. If the student (or\nparent) is married, they are not a single parent, which makes it unnecessary to ask the spouse about the EITC.\nStudent Spouse Consent, Approval, and Signature (29)\nEvery student spouse contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The student spouse contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the\nIRS.\nApproval 3 The student spouse contributor must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may\nreceive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The student spouse contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their signature on the\nonline FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nMarried, independent students who did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete\nFAFSA ready for submission. The student will receive an email confirmation that the form was submitted. The spouse will\nsee an abbreviated confirmation that the form is complete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide\nan email address will receive email notification when their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA\nSubmission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission\nSummary.\nContributor: Parent\nThis section consists of 12 questions related to the parent of a dependent student.\nDependent students will always have at least one parent contributor. If the student is completing the FAFSA form online,\nthey will be prompted to enter their parent9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and email\naddress) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The parent will be notified by email that they have been invited\nto contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The parent should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and\npassword to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s parent is married\nand filed their 2023 taxes jointly with their current spouse, only one parent contributor is required. If the student9s parent\nis either (1) married or remarried, or (2) unmarried and living together, and did not file their 2023 taxes jointly with their\ncurrent spouse or partner, the parent9s spouse or partner will be a required contributor on the student9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent complete the parent section.\nWho Counts as a Parent on the FAFSA?\nIn most cases, it9s clear who the parents are. A parent is a biological or adoptive parent, or a person that the state has\ndetermined to be a parent (for example, when a state allows another person9s name to be listed as a parent on a birth\ncertificate). A stepparent is considered a parent if married to a biological or adoptive parent and if the student counts\nthem in their family size. Biological and adoptive parents who are unmarried and living together select that as their\nmarital status, and both report their information on the FAFSA form.",
        "Equivalency Test (HiSET) or the Test Assessing Secondary Completion (TASC), as well as those established by states, for\nexample, the California High School Proficiency Exam (CHSPE). California considers a passing grade on the CHSPE to be\nequivalent to a diploma.\n<None of the previous= includes those who have the recognized equivalent of a high school diploma other than a state-\nrecognized certificate or who may qualify under the Ability-to-Benefit (ATB) alternatives (see Volume 1, Chapter 1 of the\nFSA Handbook for additional information on ATB alternatives).\nIf the student selects <High School Diploma,= they must include the name, city and state (or FC for foreign country) where\nthe student received or will receive their diploma. On the FAFSA website, the student can use city and state to search for\ntheir high school. If they are unable to find their high school using the search functionality, they can manually enter the\nhigh school information. If the student selects <State-recognized high school equivalent,= they must indicate the\nequivalent type (GED, TASC, HiSET, or Other) and the issuing state. See Volume 1, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook,\nregarding a school9s policy about checking the validity of a high school diploma.\nFederal Benefits Received (18)\nA student may be eligible to have their assets excluded from the SAI calculation if they (or someone in their family)\nreceived one (or more) of the following federal benefits during the 2023 or 2024 calendar years.\nEarned income credit (EIC)\nFederal housing assistance\nFree or reduced-price school lunch*\nMedicaid\nRefundable credit for coverage under a qualified health plan (QHP)\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI)\nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)\n*Some individuals may receive free or reduced-price school lunch due to community eligibility rather than household\neligibility. Students should only indicate they received free or reduced-price school lunch on the FAFSA form if they meet\nthe income eligibility guidelines published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nStudent Tax Filing Status (19)\nThis three-part question asks the following:\n1. If the student did (or will) file a 2023 IRS 1040 or 1040-NR.\n2. Whether the student either (1) earned income in a foreign country in 2023, (2) worked for an international\norganization in 2023 and was not required to report income on any tax return, or (3) filed a 2023 tax return in Puerto\nRico or another U.S. territory.\n3. Finally, married students are asked if they filed their 2023 tax return with their current spouse.\nUnmarried students who answer <no= to the first two parts of the question are considered non-tax filers and, if\nindependent, do not need to answer any additional questions about income or assets. Married students who answer <no=\nto the first two parts of the question will still need to provide identity and contact information about their spouse.\nRecognized Equivalent of a High School Diploma\n34 CFR 600.2",
        "professional judgment by schools during the award years applicable to the qualifying emergency.\nThe Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, Maximum Pell Grant, and PJ\nThe amount a taxpayer claims as the foreign earned income exclusion counts as untaxed income on the FAFSA form.\nBecause this appears in untaxed income rather than the AGI, it will not be counted when determining students9 eligibility\nfor a maximum Pell Grant. As we noted in Dear Colleague Letter GEN-23-11, there will be a C flag on the ISIR that\nindicates to schools to review how the amount impacts a student9s eligibility for the maximum Pell Grant prior to awarding\naid. As we instructed in our online Q & As (SAI-Q5 and SAI-Q6) FAAs must review eligibility for applicants (and their spouse\nor parent) who reported receiving a foreign earned income exclusion and are eligible for the maximum Pell Grant award. If\nan ISIR contains both a Maximum Pell indicator flag and a valid value in the <Foreign Earned Income Exclusion= data field,\nwe will flag the ISIR for the FAA to review.\nThe FAA will determine4via manual or estimated SAI calculation4if adding the exempted foreign income to the adjusted\ngross income (AGI) would make the student ineligible to receive the maximum Pell Grant award. If that would occur, the\nFAA must determine whether it is appropriate to use PJ to account for the foreign income in determining the student9s\neligibility for the maximum Pell Grant. If the FAA decides that it is appropriate, the FAA may move the foreign earned\nincome amount from untaxed income to AGI or request additional documentation of the foreign income prior to\nperforming the adjustment. If the FAA decides to add the untaxed foreign earned income to the AGI, the FAA must check\nthe PJ flag on the ISIR before submitting the correction.\nRefusing or Reducing a Loan\nFAAs may also use their discretion to refuse or reduce Direct Loan funds if they document the reason, make the\ndetermination on a case-by-case basis, notify the student in writing, and ensure the decision is not due to discrimination\nbased on race, national origin, religion, sex, income, age, or disability.\nUnusual Circumstances\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act provides a clearer directive for FAAs to assist applicants with unusual circumstances to\nadjust dependency status on the FAFSA form to reflect students9 situations more accurately (dependency overrides). Like\nother types of professional judgments, institutions must make students aware of their ability to request an adjustment for\nForeign Earned Income Exclusion PJ Example\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 4: A dependent student9s parent has an overseas business that earns income for\nwhich the parent claims the foreign earned income exclusion on Schedule 1 of their IRS Form 1040. The FAA\nnotices this amount on the ISIR and that the Maximum Pell indicator flag has been set, which means that the FAA\nis required to review the case. The FAA does a manual calculation of the student9s SAI with the amount of the\nexclusion included as AGI rather than as untaxed income. Because the amount is the maximum that could be\nclaimed ($120,000 for tax year 2023, transferring the amount from untaxed income to AGI makes the student\nineligible for an automatic maximum Pell Grant. The FAA decides to use PJ to move the amount of the foreign\nearned income exclusion to the parent9s AGI.\nRefusing or Reducing a Loan\n34 CFR 685.301(a)(8)",

If the parent\nspouse is completing their section using the paper (PDF) FAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field.

Applicants without an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nRole: Preparer\nIf someone other than the student, student spouse, parent, or parent spouse or partner completed a portion of the FAFSA\nform on the applicant9s behalf, that person must complete the Preparer section. Paid preparers are prohibited. This\nsection consists of three questions related to the unpaid preparer.",
        "However, there will be instances where manual entry of tax information will be necessary.\nThis information comes directly from the 2023 federal tax return of the parent9s (and parent9s spouse if married and filed\njointly with their current spouse). See the discussion of tax return data in the <Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)=\nquestion for a list of data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX or be manually entered by the parent.\nAnnual Child Support Received (39)\nAnnual child support received is included as an asset of the recipient in the SAI formula. If a dependent student9s parent\n(and their spouse or partner) received child support in the last complete calendar year, they should enter the total\namount received for all children in the family size in this question.\nParent Assets (40)\nAn asset is property that the family owns and has an exchange value. The FAFSA form collects current data (as of the day\nof signing the FAFSA form) about cash, savings, and checking accounts; investments; real estate; businesses; and\ninvestment farms.

A dependent student with\nmarried parents who filed their 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse will need to provide the parent9s spouse9s\nidentity and contact information. If all required information is provided and the FAFSA form is submitted, the student will\nreceive an email confirmation. The parent will see an abbreviated confirmation, letting them know that the form is\ncomplete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide an email address will receive email notification\nwhen their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who do not provide\nan email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nContributor: Parent Spouse or Partner\nThis section consists of five questions related to the spouse or partner of a parent of a dependent student. If the student9s\nparent is married, the spouse9s information is always required on the FAFSA form. If the student9s parent is unmarried and\nliving with a partner, the partner9s information is only required on the FAFSA form if the partner is also the student9s legal\nparent.\nThe parent spouse or partner is only a required contributor on the FAFSA form if the parent is either (1) married or\nremarried and did not file taxes jointly with their current spouse in 2023, or (2) unmarried and living with the student9s\nother legal parent. If the parent contributor is completing the FAFSA form online and the parent9s spouse is identified as a\nrequired contributor, the parent will be prompted to enter the parent spouse9s or partner9s identity information (name,\nSocial Security number, date of birth, and email address) to invite them to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The\nparent spouse or partner will be notified by email that they have been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form.\nThe spouse or partner should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and password to access the student9s\nFAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the parent9s spouse is not a required contributor, the parent will\nenter the same identifying information and email address, but the parent9s spouse will not be invited to contribute to the\nstudent9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent9s spouse or partner complete the",
        "Chapter 2: Filling Out the FAFSA\nWe added a section on signatures which describes the appropriate use of the signature page from the FAFSA Partner\nPortal (FPP).\nWe expanded the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)= section to include subsections on (1) nontax filers, foreign\ncountries, and international organizations and (2) fiscal year tax returns.\nWe updated the tax line number used for education credits to IRS Form 1040: line 29 + IRS Form 1040 Schedule 3:\nline 3.\nWe moved the section on foreign earned income exclusion to Chapter 5.\nWe expanded <Parent Tax Filing Status (37)= section to explain the six answer options on the FAFSA form and when\neach answer should be selected. This section also explains when an answer to this question might be conflicting\ninformation that requires resolution (comment code 303).\nChapter 3: Student Aid Index (SAI) and Pell Grant Eligibility\nEdits to this chapter include general changes and updated links, but no significant changes or reorganization.\nChapter 4: Verification, Updates, and Corrections\nWe added a note regarding the unavailability of the Verification of Identity functionality in the FPP and the flexibility\nthe Department provided around reporting timeframes.\nWe added a note to the <Using the Tax Return= section regarding the treatment negative values when calculating\nIncome Earned from Work.\nWe renamed the <Special Cases= section to <Unique Situations and Exceptions= and moved <Verification for Confined\nor Incarcerated Individuals= to a subsection under this renamed section.\nUnder <Filers of Amended Returns=, we removed the exception to not update tax information for certain amended\ntax return filers. This exception was outlined in Electronic Announcement GEN-24-29 and was limited to the 2024-25\napplication cycle.\nWe updated acceptable documentation guidance for individuals who are victims of tax-related identity theft.\nWe added subsection <Birth of a Child= under the <Updating Information= section.\nChapter 5: Special Cases\nWe moved the section on foreign earned income exclusion from Chapter 2.",

If the parent is completing their section of the form\nusing the paper (PDF) FAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field. In both application methods, the parent should\nenter their ITIN, if they have one, in the ITIN field.\nParent Contact Information (31)\nThis is the parent9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address.\nParent Current Marital Status (32)\nThis is the parent9s marital status <as of today= 3 the day the application is signed. Marital status cannot be projected. It\ncan be updated in limited circumstances; see Chapter 4.\nA student9s parent in a relationship that meets the criteria for common-law marriage in their state of legal residence\nshould select <married=. If the state doesn9t consider their situation to be a common-law marriage or doesn9t recognize\ncommon-law marriage, then they aren9t married; parents would report that they are unmarried and living together. Check\nwith the appropriate state agency concerning the definition of a common-law marriage.\nParent State of Legal Residence (33)\nThis is used to determine which poverty guideline to use when evaluating eligibility for a Maximum or Minimum Pell Grant\nfor a dependent student.\nFamily Size (34)\nSee <Family Size (9)= in the student section for further explanation of family size for online filers.\nFor paper (PDF) FAFSA filers, family size appears in both the student and parent contributor sections of the form. The\ninformation reported in the parent section of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form will supersede information reported in the\nstudent section, if applicable.\nThe following persons are included in the family size of a dependent student:\nThe student\nThe parent (and their spouse or partner)\nThe parent9s dependent children, (even if they live apart from the parents due to a qualifying temporary absence\nunder IRS code, such as living apart due to college enrollment) who will receive more than half of their support from\nthe parent (and spouse or partner) from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026. Unborn children should not be included\nin the family size, though the family size can be updated if the child is born and will receive more than half of their\nsupport from the parent (and spouse or partner) during the award year.\nOther persons who live with and receive more than half their support from the parent (and spouse or partner) and\nwill receive more than half support for the entire award year.\nNumber in College (35)\nWhile number in college is no longer used to calculate a student9s SAI, the FAFSA Simplification Act requires the question\nto be included on the FAFSA form. Schools can use the information provided to perform a special circumstance adjustment\nfor a student. See <Professional Judgment= in Chapter 5: Special Cases of this volume for additional information.\nThe student is always included in the number in college. Also included are those in the family size who are or will be\nenrolled at least half time during the award year in a degree or certificate program at a Title IV-eligible school.\nFederal Benefits Received (36)\nA student may be eligible to have their and their parents9 assets excluded from the SAI calculation if they (or someone in\ntheir family) received one (or more) federal benefits during the 2023 or 2024 calendar years. See the <Federal Benefits",

This may be the same number as your AGI.\nFiscal Year Tax Returns\nFor a fiscal year (rather than calendar year) tax return, the individual should use information from the return that includes\nthe greater length of time in 2023. For example, an individual who files a fiscal year tax return that begins in September\nwould have two tax returns that overlap the 2023 calendar year 3 September 1, 2022, thru August 31, 2023, (FY23) and\nSeptember 1, 2023, thru August 31, 2024, (FY24). Since the FY23 tax return covers 8 months of the 2023 calendar year\nand the FY24 tax return covers 4 months of the 2023 calendar year, the individual should use the FY23 tax return that\nbegins on September 1, 2022, to complete the FAFSA form.\nNote: There are more days in the year between July 1 and December 31 (184 days) than between January 1 and June 30\n(181, or 182 in a leap year). Keep that in mind when determining the length of time attributed to a fiscal year tax return\nthat begins on July 1.\nStudent 2023 Tax Return Information (20)\nFor U.S. tax filers, much of the information in Question 20 will be transferred directly from the IRS via the FA-DDX.\nHowever, as noted previously, there will be instances where manual entry of tax information will be necessary.\nThis information comes directly from the 2023 federal tax return of the student9s (and the student9s spouse, if married\nand filed jointly with their current spouse). Non-tax filers will not be required to provide this information. The first list\nbelow is data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX, if available. The second list is data elements that the student\nmust enter manually.\nFA-DDX Transferred Data\nFiling status. Single, head of household, married filing jointly, married filing separately, or qualifying surviving\nspouse.\nIncome earned from work. From IRS Form 1040 (or IRS Form 1040-NR): line 1z + Schedule 1: lines 3 + 6.\nTax exempt interest income. From IRS Form 1040: line 2a.\nUntaxed portions of IRA distributions. The filer reports the full amount, including rollovers, of the untaxed\nportion, which is determined from IRS Form 1040: line 4a minus 4b. Rollover amounts are manually entered\nseparately and excluded in the SAI formula calculation.\nUntaxed portions of pensions. The filer reports the full amount, including rollovers, of the untaxed portion, which\nis determined from IRS Form 1040: line 5a minus 5b. Rollover amounts are manually entered separately and\nexcluded in the SAI formula calculation.\nAdjusted gross income. From IRS Form 1040 (or IRS Form 1040-NR): line 11. Amount can be negative.\nIncome tax paid. From IRS Form 1040: line 24\nIRA deductions and payments to self-employed SEP, SIMPLE, and qualified plans. From IRS Form 1040\nSchedule 1: total of lines 16 + 20.\nEducation credits. Includes American Opportunity (AOTC) and Lifetime Learning (LLC) credits. From IRS\nForm 1040: line 29 + IRS Form 1040 Schedule 3: line 3.\nSchedules filed. Did the tax filer file a Schedule A, B, D, E, F, or H?\nNet business profit or loss. From IRS Form 1040 Schedule C: line 31. Amount can be negative.\nManually Entered Data/Manually Provided Tax-Payer Data\nIRA rollover into another IRA or qualified plan. Typically indicated as \"ROLLOVER\" on IRS Form 1040-line 4.\nPension rollover into an IRA or other qualified plan. Typically indicated as \"ROLLOVER\" on IRS Form 1040-line\n5.\nEarned income credit (EIC) received. IRS Form 1040: line 27.\nTaxable grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits. This question is optional. The student should report only\nthe amount of grants and scholarships received (by the student and the student9s spouse, if applicable) that was\nreported as taxable income on the return. This includes grant and scholarship (not employment) portions of\nfellowships and assistantships, as well as taxable stipends and employer tuition reimbursements. Include AmeriCorps",
        "reconcile the conflicting information and take appropriate action under the specific program requirements (depending on\nthe outcome, funds may have to be returned).\nSubsequent ISIRs\nYou are generally required to review all subsequent transactions for a student for the entire processing year even if you\nverified an earlier transaction. An exception to this requirement is if a later transaction comes in after the student is no\nlonger enrolled at your institution. Review the SAI, C flag, or verification tracking group for changes. Review new\ncomments or NSLDS information that impacts eligibility for aid. Check any updates or corrections. If the SAI has not\nchanged and there are no changes in the C flag, verification tracking group, or NSLDS information, no action is generally\nrequired. If the SAI does change but it either doesn9t affect the amount and type of aid received or the data elements that\nchanged were already verified, no action is required. But if the SAI changes and the pertinent data elements were not\nverified, then you must investigate. Of course, any time the C flag changes or NSLDS data have been modified, you must\nresolve any conflicts.\nDiscrepant Tax Data\nFinancial aid administrators do not need to be tax experts, but there are some issues that even a layperson with basic tax\nlaw information can evaluate. Because conflicting data often involve such information, FAAs must have a fundamental\nunderstanding of relevant tax issues that can impact the need analysis. You are obligated to know (1) whether a person\nwas required to file a tax return and (2) what the correct filing status for a person should be. The IRS9s online Interactive\nTax Assistant can help with these and other issues by walking the user through a series of questions. IRS Publication 17 is\nalso a useful resource.\nResolution of Conflicting Information\nYou must resolve conflicting information prior to disbursing aid to a student enrolled at your school. Even if the conflict\nconcerns a previous award year, you must still investigate it. You have resolved the matter when you have\ndetermined which data are correct; this might simply be confirming that an earlier determination was the right one. You\nmust document your findings and include an explanation that justifies your decision.\nThe verification page on the FSA Assessments site has guidance to help you review your conflicting information\nprocedures; see Activity 1.\nReferral of Fraud Cases\nRequirement to Verify Questionable Data\n34 CFR 668.54(a)(2)\nDiscrepant Tax Data Example\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 7: An FAA notices that a dependent student9s parents, who are married and live\ntogether, have each filed as head of household (which offers a greater tax deduction than filing as single or\nmarried). The FAA must ask if that is the right status. Resolution of the conflict could be the parents refiling and\nsubmitting a copy of the amended return or a reasonable explanation of why there is no conflict under IRS rules.",
        "Indicators for Schedules A, B, D, E, F, H\nIRS response code\nIn some limited circumstances, the student or contributor may need to manually provide data if it is unavailable through\nthe FA-DDX or does not reflect their current personal circumstances. In these cases, manually entered data will be used in\nthe SAI calculation. For example, a contributor would be required to manually report income and tax data if they were\nmarried and filed their 2023 U.S. tax return jointly with their spouse but are now divorced.\nIRS Response Codes\nThe IRS will provide one of the following response codes for each contributor, and they will appear on a student9s ISIR.\nCode\nIndication\n200\nUsable FTI data retrieved successfully\n214\nNo return on file\n203\n206\n212\nNo usable FTI data retrieved\nThe IRS provides a response code value of <200= when the IRS has data and it was successfully shared with FSA for\ninclusion on the applicant9s FAFSA form. Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler.\nIRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution.\nContributors\n<Contributor= refers to anyone who is required to provide information, consent, and approval, and a signature on the\nFAFSA form. The FAFSA form is organized by contributor. Each contributor will complete their own section of the form\nwhich contains specific questions and instructions pertaining to that contributor. The guidance in this chapter\nsupplements those instructions and explains why some of the questions are needed on the FAFSA form.\nThe following sections discuss the questions found within each contributor section on the FAFSA form. The parents\nmentioned are the legal parents of dependent students. The numbers in parentheses are for the items as they appear on\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary, ISIR, paper (PDF) FAFSA, and FAFSA Partner Portal. The FAFSA form is considered a\n<snapshot= of the family9s information as of the date the application is signed and it can be updated only in certain\ncircumstances and only for certain items. See Chapter 4 for more information about updating a FAFSA form.\nContributor: Student\nThis section consists of 24 questions related to the student.\nStudent Identity Information (1)\nThis question requests the name, date of birth, and Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification\nNumber (ITIN) of the student contributor. The name, with other identifying information, is used for several data matches.",
        "However, a stepparent who did not adopt the student cannot be the sole parent for determining dependency status. If one\nparent dies, the student is still a dependent of the remaining biological or adoptive parent, not the stepparent.\nIf parents are divorced or never married and not living together, the parent on the FAFSA form should be the parent who\nprovided more than 50% of the financial support for the student during the last 12 months. This may be different from the\nparent the student lived with during that same period. If one parent pays child support and/or alimony to the other parent,\nthe amount paid counts for the payer when determining which parent provided more than 50% of the student9s financial\nsupport and is a required contributor on the FAFSA form. Once the parent who provides more than 50% of the financial\nsupport for the student has been determined, that parent (and their current spouse, if applicable) should report their\nfinancial information on the student9s FAFSA form as a contributor.\nIf neither parent provided more than 50% of the financial support for the student (including when neither parent provided\nsupport for the student) during the last 12 months, the parent with the greater income and assets is a required\ncontributor on the FAFSA form. Once the parent with the greater income and assets has been determined, that parent\n(and their current spouse, if applicable) should report their financial information on the student9s FAFSA form.\nNote: It is not typical that a student will receive support from both parents exactly equally. Usually, you can determine\nthat the student received more than half support from one of the parents.\nA foster parent or a legal guardian is not treated as a parent for Title IV purposes. If at any time since the age of 13 both\nstudent9s parents were dead (and they did not have an adoptive parent at that time) or the student was in foster care,\nthey are independent. If the student is now or was when they became an adult an emancipated minor or in legal\nguardianship, the student is independent.\nIf a student is living with their grandparents or other relatives, their data should not be reported on the FAFSA form as\nparental data unless they have adopted the student.\nParent Identity Information (30)\nLike the student, the parent identity information should match what appears on their social security card. If the parent\nSurviving Parent and Stepparent Example\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 9: A dependent student9s parents divorced when the student was five years old. The\nstudent9s mother remarried, and the student lived with her and the student9s stepfather, who did not adopt the\nstudent. The student9s mother died last year, but the student9s biological father is still living. The student does not\nmeet any of the criteria to be independent. Because the student9s biological father is the only surviving parent,\nthe student needs to report the biological father9s information on the FAFSA form, even if the student is still living\nwith and being supported by the stepfather.\nStudent Living With Relatives Example\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 10: A student9s father is dead, and the student9s mother can9t support the student,\nso the student is living with their grandparents. The student9s mother doesn9t pay any money for the student9s\nsupport. The student doesn9t meet any of the independence criteria, so the student must provide parental\ninformation. Because the student9s grandparents haven9t adopted the student, they are not the student9s parents.\nThe student will have to provide information about their mother on the form unless there are unusual\ncircumstances that would warrant a dependency override or the student may elect to receive only unsubsidized\nloans. See Chapter 5 for additional guidance on unusual circumstances.",
        "Because the Department matches the student9s name and SSN with the Social Security Administration (SSA), the name on\nthe FAFSA form should match the one in the SSA9s records (i.e., as it appears on the student9s Social Security card).\nStudents (except citizens of one of the Freely Associated States 3 see <Account Username and Password= in Chapter 1)\nmust have an SSN to apply for federal student aid. If they submit a paper (PDF) FAFSA form without an SSN, the FAFSA\nform will be returned unprocessed. Students will be unable to submit a FAFSA form electronically without an account\nusername and password, which requires an SSN (except students who are citizens one of the Freely Associated States).\nThe student must contact the local SSA office to get an SSN or to find out what the number is if they lost their Social\nSecurity card. Go to https://www.ssa.gov/number-card for more information.\nIf the student9s name, date of birth, or SSN does not match with the Social Security Administration, the student typically\nneeds to resolve the issue with the SSA. If the information submitted is correct, the student must contact SSA to update\nits records. After the student receives confirmation that SSA has corrected its records, the student must contact the\nFederal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) and ask them to manually sync their data with SSA. Alternatively, if the\nstudent notifies the school that they received confirmation from SSA, the FAA may update the Resend to Matches field to\n<Y= in the FAFSA Partner Portal and submit it as a correction so the transaction can go back to SSA for an updated match\nflag. Records sent for rematching will continue to receive this match flag until SSA updates its database.\nStudents who enter their name, date of birth, or SSN incorrectly should log in to StudentAid.gov and update their\ninformation in Account Settings. The record will be resent to SSA for matching. Once SSA verifies the account, the\nstudent should update their FAFSA form by submitting a correction.\nStudent Contact Information (2)\nThis is the student9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address, with three exceptions:\nStudents under the age of 13 should not provide an email address as FSA cannot communicate with them\nelectronically. See <FAFSA Filers Under the Age of 13= in Chapter 1 for additional information.\nIncarcerated students should use an address where they can reliably receive mail. This may be the physical address\nof the facility they are in, the address of the school (if permitted by the school), or a central processing facility used\nby the facility for mail distribution. If a prison ID number is required by the facility for the applicant to receive mail,\nthe applicant should list that at the end of the address field. If an incarcerated student is released, they should also\nupdate their address in their StudentAid.gov account or on their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nHomeless students should use a mailing address where they can reliably receive mail. That can be the address of a\nrelative or friend who has given them permission to use it, or it can be their school9s address if they have contacted\nthe school for permission and instructions on how mail they receive at the school will reach them. As soon as\nhomeless students have more permanent housing, they should update their address in their StudentAid.gov account\nor on their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nIf the student provides an email address, they should get an email with a link to their online FAFSA Submission Summary\nwithin one to three days after the FPS receives the completed application. The Department will also use this email address\nto correspond with the student regarding their application.\nStudent Current Marital Status (3)\nThis is marital status <as of today= 3 the day the application is signed. Marital status cannot be projected. It can be\nupdated in limited circumstances; see Chapter 4.\nA student who is only engaged should select <single (never married)= unless they wait until after their marriage date to\ncomplete the FAFSA form. A student in a relationship that meets the criteria for common-law marriage in their state of\nlegal residence should select <married= and will be considered independent. A student who is separated from their spouse\nshould select <separated= and will be considered a dependent student for FAFSA purposes, unless they meet other criteria\nto be considered an independent student.\nStudent College or Career School Plans (4)\nStudents should answer this question based on the degree or certificate program they will be working on at the start of"

The information of other schools the student\nincluded on the FAFSA form will not appear except on the FAFSA Submission Summary and on ISIRs sent to state grant\nagencies. See Volume 6 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specification Guide.\nStudent Consent, Approval, and Signature (24)\nEvery student must provide the following to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The student must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the IRS.\nApproval 3 The student must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may receive, use, and\nredisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The student9s FSA ID (account username and password) will serve as their signature on the online\nFAFSA form. Paper (PDF) FAFSA form filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nIn addition to certifying that the data on the FAFSA form is correct, the student is also signing a statement of educational\npurpose, which is required to receive Title IV funds. Among other things, the student agrees to spend Title IV funds only\non educational expenses and affirms that they are not in default on a federal loan and do not owe a grant overpayment.\nFAFSA Submission\nStudents who do not have any other required contributors now have a complete FAFSA form. Students who complete and\nsubmit their FAFSA form online will receive an email version of their confirmation page. When the applicant9s FAFSA form\nis processed, students who provided an email address will receive an email notification of processing with instructions to\naccess their FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their\nFAFSA Submission Summary. Applicants with additional required contributors will need these individuals to contribute to\ntheir FAFSA form, as described next.\nContributor: Student Spouse\nThis section consists of five questions related to the student9s spouse. The student9s spouse is a required contributor on\nthe FAFSA form if the student is married and did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse.\nIf a married student is completing the FAFSA form online and the student9s spouse is identified as a required contributor,\nthe student will be prompted to enter their spouse9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and\nemail address) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The student spouse will be notified by email that they\nhave been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The spouse should use their own StudentAid.gov account\nusername and password to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s\nspouse is not a required contributor, the student will enter the same identifying information and email address, but the\nstudent9s spouse will not be invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their spouse complete the student spouse\ncontributor section.\nStudent Spouse Identity Information (25)\nLike the student, the student spouse identity information should match what appears on their social security card. If the\nstudent spouse does not have a Social Security number and is completing their section of the form online, the SSN field\nwill be blank, based on their StudentAid.gov account information. If they are completing their section on the paper (PDF)\nFAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field. In both application methods, the student spouse should enter their\nITIN, if they have one, in the ITIN field.\nStudent Spouse Contact Information (26)\nThis is the student spouse9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address.\nStudent Spouse Tax Filing Status (27)",

It also asks about income\nearned in a foreign country or if the parent spouse or partner filed a tax return in a U.S. territory.

A dependent student with\nmarried parents who filed their 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse will need to provide the parent9s spouse9s\nidentity and contact information. If all required information is provided and the FAFSA form is submitted, the student will\nreceive an email confirmation. The parent will see an abbreviated confirmation, letting them know that the form is\ncomplete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide an email address will receive email notification\nwhen their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who do not provide\nan email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nContributor: Parent Spouse or Partner\nThis section consists of five questions related to the spouse or partner of a parent of a dependent student. If the student9s\nparent is married, the spouse9s information is always required on the FAFSA form. If the student9s parent is unmarried and\nliving with a partner, the partner9s information is only required on the FAFSA form if the partner is also the student9s legal\nparent.\nThe parent spouse or partner is only a required contributor on the FAFSA form if the parent is either (1) married or\nremarried and did not file taxes jointly with their current spouse in 2023, or (2) unmarried and living with the student9s\nother legal parent. If the parent contributor is completing the FAFSA form online and the parent9s spouse is identified as a\nrequired contributor, the parent will be prompted to enter the parent spouse9s or partner9s identity information (name,\nSocial Security number, date of birth, and email address) to invite them to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The\nparent spouse or partner will be notified by email that they have been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form.\nThe spouse or partner should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and password to access the student9s\nFAFSA form and complete their portion of the form.

It also asks about income earned in a\nforeign country or if the student spouse filed a tax return in a U.S. territory. See the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)=\nquestion for additional information.\nStudent Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28)\nThis information comes directly from the student spouse9s 2023 tax return. See the discussion of tax return data in the\n<Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX or be\nmanually entered by the student spouse. Unlike the student, the student9s spouse will not be asked to report taxable\ncollege grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits. If the student or spouse had an amount to report, the student should\nhave reported the joint total in the student section. The spouse will also not be asked about receipt of the earned income\ntax credit (EITC). Receipt of the EITC is used to determine if the student (or parent) is a single parent. If the student (or\nparent) is married, they are not a single parent, which makes it unnecessary to ask the spouse about the EITC.\nStudent Spouse Consent, Approval, and Signature (29)\nEvery student spouse contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The student spouse contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the\nIRS.\nApproval 3 The student spouse contributor must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may\nreceive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The student spouse contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their signature on the\nonline FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nMarried, independent students who did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete\nFAFSA ready for submission. The student will receive an email confirmation that the form was submitted. The spouse will\nsee an abbreviated confirmation that the form is complete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide\nan email address will receive email notification when their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA\nSubmission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission\nSummary.\nContributor: Parent\nThis section consists of 12 questions related to the parent of a dependent student.\nDependent students will always have at least one parent contributor. If the student is completing the FAFSA form online,\nthey will be prompted to enter their parent9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and email\naddress) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The parent will be notified by email that they have been invited\nto contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The parent should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and\npassword to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s parent is married\nand filed their 2023 taxes jointly with their current spouse, only one parent contributor is required. If the student9s parent\nis either (1) married or remarried, or (2) unmarried and living together, and did not file their 2023 taxes jointly with their\ncurrent spouse or partner, the parent9s spouse or partner will be a required contributor on the student9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent complete the parent section.\nWho Counts as a Parent on the FAFSA?\nIn most cases, it9s clear who the parents are. A parent is a biological or adoptive parent, or a person that the state has\ndetermined to be a parent (for example, when a state allows another person9s name to be listed as a parent on a birth\ncertificate). A stepparent is considered a parent if married to a biological or adoptive parent and if the student counts\nthem in their family size. Biological and adoptive parents who are unmarried and living together select that as their\nmarital status, and both report their information on the FAFSA form.",

If the parent is completing their section of the form\nusing the paper (PDF) FAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field. In both application methods, the parent should\nenter their ITIN, if they have one, in the ITIN field.\nParent Contact Information (31)\nThis is the parent9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address.\nParent Current Marital Status (32)\nThis is the parent9s marital status <as of today= 3 the day the application is signed. Marital status cannot be projected. It\ncan be updated in limited circumstances; see Chapter 4.\nA student9s parent in a relationship that meets the criteria for common-law marriage in their state of legal residence\nshould select <married=. If the state doesn9t consider their situation to be a common-law marriage or doesn9t recognize\ncommon-law marriage, then they aren9t married; parents would report that they are unmarried and living together. Check\nwith the appropriate state agency concerning the definition of a common-law marriage.\nParent State of Legal Residence (33)\nThis is used to determine which poverty guideline to use when evaluating eligibility for a Maximum or Minimum Pell Grant\nfor a dependent student.\nFamily Size (34)\nSee <Family Size (9)= in the student section for further explanation of family size for online filers.\nFor paper (PDF) FAFSA filers, family size appears in both the student and parent contributor sections of the form. The\ninformation reported in the parent section of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form will supersede information reported in the\nstudent section, if applicable.\nThe following persons are included in the family size of a dependent student:\nThe student\nThe parent (and their spouse or partner)\nThe parent9s dependent children, (even if they live apart from the parents due to a qualifying temporary absence\nunder IRS code, such as living apart due to college enrollment) who will receive more than half of their support from\nthe parent (and spouse or partner) from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026. Unborn children should not be included\nin the family size, though the family size can be updated if the child is born and will receive more than half of their\nsupport from the parent (and spouse or partner) during the award year.\nOther persons who live with and receive more than half their support from the parent (and spouse or partner) and\nwill receive more than half support for the entire award year.\nNumber in College (35)\nWhile number in college is no longer used to calculate a student9s SAI, the FAFSA Simplification Act requires the question\nto be included on the FAFSA form. Schools can use the information provided to perform a special circumstance adjustment\nfor a student. See <Professional Judgment= in Chapter 5: Special Cases of this volume for additional information.\nThe student is always included in the number in college. Also included are those in the family size who are or will be\nenrolled at least half time during the award year in a degree or certificate program at a Title IV-eligible school.\nFederal Benefits Received (36)\nA student may be eligible to have their and their parents9 assets excluded from the SAI calculation if they (or someone in\ntheir family) received one (or more) federal benefits during the 2023 or 2024 calendar years. See the <Federal Benefits",
        "Because the Department matches the student9s name and SSN with the Social Security Administration (SSA), the name on\nthe FAFSA form should match the one in the SSA9s records (i.e., as it appears on the student9s Social Security card).\nStudents (except citizens of one of the Freely Associated States 3 see <Account Username and Password= in Chapter 1)\nmust have an SSN to apply for federal student aid. If they submit a paper (PDF) FAFSA form without an SSN, the FAFSA\nform will be returned unprocessed. Students will be unable to submit a FAFSA form electronically without an account\nusername and password, which requires an SSN (except students who are citizens one of the Freely Associated States).\nThe student must contact the local SSA office to get an SSN or to find out what the number is if they lost their Social\nSecurity card. Go to https://www.ssa.gov/number-card for more information.\nIf the student9s name, date of birth, or SSN does not match with the Social Security Administration, the student typically\nneeds to resolve the issue with the SSA. If the information submitted is correct, the student must contact SSA to update\nits records. After the student receives confirmation that SSA has corrected its records, the student must contact the\nFederal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) and ask them to manually sync their data with SSA. Alternatively, if the\nstudent notifies the school that they received confirmation from SSA, the FAA may update the Resend to Matches field to\n<Y= in the FAFSA Partner Portal and submit it as a correction so the transaction can go back to SSA for an updated match\nflag. Records sent for rematching will continue to receive this match flag until SSA updates its database.\nStudents who enter their name, date of birth, or SSN incorrectly should log in to StudentAid.gov and update their\ninformation in Account Settings. The record will be resent to SSA for matching. Once SSA verifies the account, the\nstudent should update their FAFSA form by submitting a correction.\nStudent Contact Information (2)\nThis is the student9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address, with three exceptions:\nStudents under the age of 13 should not provide an email address as FSA cannot communicate with them\nelectronically. See <FAFSA Filers Under the Age of 13= in Chapter 1 for additional information.\nIncarcerated students should use an address where they can reliably receive mail. This may be the physical address\nof the facility they are in, the address of the school (if permitted by the school), or a central processing facility used\nby the facility for mail distribution. If a prison ID number is required by the facility for the applicant to receive mail,\nthe applicant should list that at the end of the address field. If an incarcerated student is released, they should also\nupdate their address in their StudentAid.gov account or on their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nHomeless students should use a mailing address where they can reliably receive mail. That can be the address of a\nrelative or friend who has given them permission to use it, or it can be their school9s address if they have contacted\nthe school for permission and instructions on how mail they receive at the school will reach them. As soon as\nhomeless students have more permanent housing, they should update their address in their StudentAid.gov account\nor on their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nIf the student provides an email address, they should get an email with a link to their online FAFSA Submission Summary\nwithin one to three days after the FPS receives the completed application. The Department will also use this email address\nto correspond with the student regarding their application.\nStudent Current Marital Status (3)\nThis is marital status <as of today= 3 the day the application is signed. Marital status cannot be projected. It can be\nupdated in limited circumstances; see Chapter 4.\nA student who is only engaged should select <single (never married)= unless they wait until after their marriage date to\ncomplete the FAFSA form. A student in a relationship that meets the criteria for common-law marriage in their state of\nlegal residence should select <married= and will be considered independent. A student who is separated from their spouse\nshould select <separated= and will be considered a dependent student for FAFSA purposes, unless they meet other criteria\nto be considered an independent student.\nStudent College or Career School Plans (4)\nStudents should answer this question based on the degree or certificate program they will be working on at the start of",

Instead, these individuals will be asked if their family size is different from the number of individuals claimed on their\ntax return. If they indicate there was a change, they will be asked to manually report their number of dependents in a\nfollow-up question.\nOn the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, family size appears in both the student and parent contributor sections. Dependent\nstudents are instructed to skip Question 9 on the paper (PDF) FAFSA form. Dependent students completing the online\nFAFSA form will not see the family size question in the student section.\nThe following persons are included in the family size of an independent student:\nThe student and their spouse, unless the spouse has died or is not living in the household due to separation or\ndivorce.\nThe student9s dependent children, if they live with the student (or live apart from the student due to a qualifying\ntemporary absence under IRS code, such as living apart due to college enrollment) and will receive more than half of\ntheir support from the student (and spouse) from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026.

For FAFSA forms submitted after the start of the year, see the relevant\nparagraph and example about legal dependents provided earlier in this chapter under the <Children and Legal\nDependents= section.\nNumber in College (10)\nWhile number in college is no longer used to calculate a student9s SAI, the FAFSA Simplification Act requires the question\nto be included on the FAFSA form. Schools can use the information provided to perform a special circumstance adjustment\nfor a student.

Also included are those in the family size who are or will be\nenrolled at least half time during the award year in a degree or certificate program at a Title IV-eligible school.\nStudent Demographic Information (11) and Student Race and Ethnicity (12)\nThese questions collect sex/gender and race/ethnicity information about the student. The answers to these questions will\nnot affect the student9s eligibility for federal student aid, be used in any calculations, or be shared with the schools to\nwhich the student applies. They will be used for research purposes only.\nStudent Citizenship (13)\nFamily Size Example\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 8: A married student recently separated from their spouse, and they are no longer\nliving together. They have a child together who is currently living with the student9s spouse. The student is paying\nchild support to the spouse, but it isn9t enough to provide more than half the child9s support. The spouse and child\ncannot be included in the student9s family size, even though the student and spouse are not yet legally divorced.\nHowever, the student9s nephew lives with the student and receives more than half of their support from the\nstudent (and will do so for the award year). The student can count the nephew in their family size, which is two.\nThe nephew, who recently turned 24, is an independent student on his own FAFSA form and his household size is\none.",
        "Indicators for Schedules A, B, D, E, F, H\nIRS response code\nIn some limited circumstances, the student or contributor may need to manually provide data if it is unavailable through\nthe FA-DDX or does not reflect their current personal circumstances. In these cases, manually entered data will be used in\nthe SAI calculation. For example, a contributor would be required to manually report income and tax data if they were\nmarried and filed their 2023 U.S. tax return jointly with their spouse but are now divorced.\nIRS Response Codes\nThe IRS will provide one of the following response codes for each contributor, and they will appear on a student9s ISIR.\nCode\nIndication\n200\nUsable FTI data retrieved successfully\n214\nNo return on file\n203\n206\n212\nNo usable FTI data retrieved\nThe IRS provides a response code value of <200= when the IRS has data and it was successfully shared with FSA for\ninclusion on the applicant9s FAFSA form. Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler.\nIRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution.\nContributors\n<Contributor= refers to anyone who is required to provide information, consent, and approval, and a signature on the\nFAFSA form. The FAFSA form is organized by contributor. Each contributor will complete their own section of the form\nwhich contains specific questions and instructions pertaining to that contributor. The guidance in this chapter\nsupplements those instructions and explains why some of the questions are needed on the FAFSA form.\nThe following sections discuss the questions found within each contributor section on the FAFSA form. The parents\nmentioned are the legal parents of dependent students. The numbers in parentheses are for the items as they appear on\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary, ISIR, paper (PDF) FAFSA, and FAFSA Partner Portal. The FAFSA form is considered a\n<snapshot= of the family9s information as of the date the application is signed and it can be updated only in certain\ncircumstances and only for certain items. See Chapter 4 for more information about updating a FAFSA form.\nContributor: Student\nThis section consists of 24 questions related to the student.\nStudent Identity Information (1)\nThis question requests the name, date of birth, and Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification\nNumber (ITIN) of the student contributor. The name, with other identifying information, is used for several data matches.",
        "However, you cannot update the marital status of an already independent student whose dependency status has not\nchanged because of their marriage or divorce and who was not selected for verification. In such a case you must select\nthe student for verification if you want to exercise your discretion to update their marital status and all other associated\ninformation.\nParent Post-Application Marriage\nWhile the applicant does not typically update family size because of a change in their marital status, if the applicant is a\ndependent student and their parent marries or remarries between application and verification, the student must update\nfamily size to include the new stepparent. However, the student would not count the new stepparent9s income and assets.\nA school can use professional judgment to include the stepparent9s income or to otherwise account for the change.\nBirth of a Child\nThe number of dependents included in the family size is based on the number of individuals who are claimed as\ndependents on either the applicant9s (if independent) or parent9s (if dependent) U.S. federal tax return. Therefore, unborn\nchildren are not included in the family size, though the family size can be updated if the child is born and will receive\nmore than half of their support from the student (and spouse, if applicable) or parent (and parent spouse, if applicable)\nduring the award year.\nWhen the child is born, you may update the family size in two circumstances:\n1. If the addition of the newborn changes the student9s dependency status from dependent to independent, you must\nupdate both the dependency status and family size.\n2. If the applicant is selected for verification, you should update the family size to be accurate at the time you complete\nverification. The newborn can be included in the family size if the child could be claimed as a dependent on the\nstudent9s (if independent) or parent9s (if dependent) U.S. federal tax return.\nIf an update is not allowed under one of these two options, you may choose to exercise professional judgment on a case-\nby-case basis to add the newborn to the family size if you determine that the student (or contributor) has a special\ncircumstance. See Chapter 5 of this volume for further discussion of professional judgment and special circumstances.\nCorrecting Errors\nAs explained in the last section, you only make updates in specified situations, but for students who are not selected for\nverification, you or they must correct and submit for processing any errors reported on the original FAFSA form that would\nchange the SAI or the students9 eligibility for Title IV aid.\nChanges in a Selected Applicant's FAFSA Form\nFor students who are selected for verification and receiving subsidized student aid, changes to any non-dollar item and to\nany dollar item of $25 or more must be submitted for processing.

A student aged 24 or older will not have the\nopportunity to answer this question as they are independent by age, making this question unnecessary. In FPP,\nthe answer to this question will be <Blank=; on the student9s ISIR, the answer to this question will be <No=.\nTherefore, you should not assume that a <Blank= or <No= indicates the student does not have children or other\ndependents.

Students who received a paper FAFSA Submission Summary may make\ncorrections or updates on it, then sign and return it to the FAFSA processor at the address given at the end of the FAFSA\nSubmission Summary. If a contributor9s information is updated or corrected, that contributor also must sign the FAFSA\nSubmission Summary before submitting it for processing.\nStudents who applied electronically are encouraged to return to their Dashboard on StudentAid.gov to make corrections.\nStudents who applied electronically but would like to make corrections via paper may have a paper FAFSA Submission\nSummary mailed to them by calling the FSAIC at 1-800-4-FED-AID and providing their name, SSN, and date of birth,\nthough this feature may not be available until later in the application cycle.\nAdding Schools and Changing a Student9s Address\nAs with other changes, a student can add schools or change their address, email address, or telephone number online or\non a paper FAFSA Submission Summary. A student can also update these items over the phone by calling 1-800-433-3243\nand providing their DRN, though this feature may not be available until later in the application cycle. You can submit\nthose changes for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal if your school is listed on the student9s application, or you\nhave the student9s DRN.\nThe FAFSA form has limited space for a student to list schools that will receive the application data: 10 schools can be\nlisted on the paper application; 20 schools can be listed on the online FAFSA form. If the student wants information sent to\nmore schools, the student can use any of the methods listed previously to replace some or all the original schools. If the\nstudent originally listed 20 schools on the application and then replaced two schools with two new ones, those that were\nreplaced will not receive an ISIR from this correction or any subsequent correction on which they did not appear.\nSignatures\nAny required signatures, such as those on worksheets or on copies of tax returns, must be collected at the time of\nverification4they cannot be collected after the verification deadline for that award year.\nFor verification documentation, a school may collect an electronic signature for an applicant, parent, or spouse if the\nprocess includes an assurance of the identity of the person signing. This is often accomplished with a PIN or password that\nis assigned only after the identity of the signer has been authenticated (see DOC-Q12 on the Program Integrity Questions\nand Answers 3 Verification).\nDeadlines and Failure to Submit Documentation\nYou must require students selected for verification4either by your school or the Department4to submit the\ndocumentation by the date specified by your school (for Campus-Based and Direct Loans) or the Department (for Pell).\nCampus-Based and Direct Loans\nIf a student doesn9t provide verification documentation within your school9s established, reasonable timeframe, you\ncannot:\nDisburse more FSEOG funds,\nEmploy or permit further FWS employment, or\nFailure to Submit Documentation\n34 CFR 668.60"

      "question": "What happens if a parent says they didn’t file a tax return but has foreign income affecting SAI?",
      "response": "If a parent indicates that they did not file a U.S. tax return but has foreign income that affects the Student Aid Index (SAI), the guidance suggests that you'd need to manually enter their income and tax information. Since foreign income does not typically generate a U.S. tax return, it requires conversion into U.S. dollars and manual input into the FAFSA form. \n\nAdditionally, you should verify whether the foreign income impacts the student's Pell Grant eligibility, especially if the foreign earned income exclusion was claimed, as it counts as untaxed income and could affect eligibility. In such cases, the Financial Aid Administrator (FAA) may consider using professional judgment to include foreign income in the SAI calculation appropriately, potentially adjusting how the income is reported (e.g., moving it from untaxed income to AGI).\n\nIf there is conflicting information—such as the parent having foreign income but no filed return—you may need to request additional documentation or clarification to accurately determine the student's eligibility.\n\nIn summary, if a parent didn't file a U.S. tax return but has foreign income, it generally involves manual entry of the foreign income, conversion to U.S. dollars, and possible professional judgment considerations to assess its impact on aid eligibility.",

        "Received (18)= question for a list of these federal benefits.\nParent Tax Filing Status (37)\nThis question asks if the parent filed (or will file) a 2023 IRS 1040 or 1040-NR. If the answer is <no=, the parent will be\nasked to select one of the following reasons for not filing:\n1. The parent filed or will file a tax return with Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory.\n2. The parent filed or will file a foreign tax return.\n3. The parent either earned income in a foreign country but did not and will not file a foreign tax return, or worked for\nan international organization and was not required to report income on any tax return.\n4. The parent, even though they earned income in the U.S., did not and will not file a U.S. tax return because their\nincome was below the filing threshold.\n5. The parent did not and will not file a U.S. tax return for reasons other than low income.\n6. The parent did not and will not file any tax return because they did not earn any income or they were not required to\nfile under the Internal Revenue Code.\nThe purpose of these questions is to determine if a parent was either (1) required to file a 2023 U.S. federal tax return and\ndid not or (2) has income from a foreign country that must be manually entered on the FAFSA form.\nA dependent student will be automatically eligible for a Maximum Pell Grant if their parent (and parent9s spouse or\npartner) is subject to the U.S. Tax Code but is not required to file a 2023 U.S. federal tax return. The student will be\nassigned an SAI of -1,500 and will not be required to provide any further financial information on the FAFSA form.\nFinally, married parents are asked if they filed their 2023 tax return with their current spouse. Individuals who were\nmarried and filed jointly with the IRS and are no longer married to the spouse on the applicable tax return, or who have\nmarried a different spouse, will be required to manually enter their income and tax information. See the <Joint Return\nFilers Who Are No Longer Married= section in Chapter 4 for additional information on separating tax return and income\ninformation.\nIndividuals who only file foreign tax returns will also be unable to use the FA-DDX since it does not link to foreign tax\nauthorities. They will instead need to manually input their income and tax data by converting foreign currency to U.S.\ndollars and entering the resulting amounts in the comparable fields from U.S. tax returns. See the <Student Tax Filing\nStatus (19)= question for additional information.\nIf the parent indicates they earned income in a foreign country but did not file a foreign tax return, or worked for an\ninternational organization, such as the United Nations, World Bank, or International Monetary Fund (option 3), they will\nneed to manually input their income and tax data, similar to individuals who file foreign tax returns. See <Non-tax filers,\nforeign countries, and international organizations= under <Student Tax Filing Status (19)= for additional guidance.\nIf a parent indicates they did not file a U.S. tax return for reasons other than low income (option 5), you should treat this\nas conflicting information and request documentation to resolve it, which may include requiring the individual to file a tax\nreturn and present sufficient documentation of filing to you.\nIf a parent indicates they did not file any tax return because they did not earn any income (option 6) and their state of\nlegal residence is a foreign country, you must determine if the parent has foreign untaxed income that, when included in\nthe SAI calculation, impacts a student9s Pell Grant eligibility. Comment code 303 on the student9s ISIR should prompt you\nto request additional documentation. If your inquiry into the parents9 financial situation shows that the student might be\neligible for less or no Pell grant funds, you may use PJ to account for the parents9 untaxed income and assets, similar to\nthe action you might take when there is a substantial foreign earned income exclusion on a U.S. tax return that can affect\na student9s Pell eligibility.\nParent 2023 Tax Return Information (38)\nFor U.S. tax filers, much of the information in Question 38 will be transferred directly from the IRS via the FA-DDX.",
        "Dependent students who answer <no= to the first to parts of the question will still need to provide answers to questions\nabout their assets if their parents are required to provide financial information.\nIndependent students are automatically eligible for a Maximum Pell Grant if they (and their spouse, if married) are not\nrequired to file a 2023 federal tax return. Such students will be assigned an SAI of -1,500 and will not be required to\nprovide any further financial information on the FAFSA form.\nIndividuals who were married and filed jointly with the IRS and are no longer married to the spouse on the applicable tax\nreturn, and/or who have married a different spouse, will be required to manually enter their income and tax information.\nSee the <Joint Return Filers Who Are No Longer Married= section in Chapter 4 for additional information on separating tax\nreturn and income information.\nIndividuals who only file foreign tax returns will also be unable to use the FA-DDX since it does not link to foreign tax\nauthorities. They will instead need to manually input their income and tax data by converting foreign currency to U.S.\ndollars and entering the resulting amounts in the comparable fields from U.S. tax returns.\nPuerto Rico and Other U.S. Territory Residents\nSome individuals who reside in Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory may use an IRS Form 1040 or 1040-NR but file their\ntaxes with their local tax authority, not the IRS. These individuals should answer <No= to the question <Did or will the\nstudent file a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR?= and <Yes= to the subsequent question to indicate they filed a tax return\nwith Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory.\nAdditionally, some individuals who live and work in Puerto Rico may file two tax returns 3 one with the IRS and one with\nthe Puerto Rico tax authority. If they are filing electronically and FTI is available via the FA-DDX, only their tax information\nfiled with the IRS will be imported to the FAFSA form. They will not be able to manually enter the information from their\ntax return filed with Puerto Rico. If the FAA is aware of this dual filing scenario, the FAA should evaluate the applicant9s\ninformation and determine if the information from the Puerto Rico tax return should replace the information imported\nfrom the IRS. FAAs who determine that the information from the Puerto Rico tax return should be on the FAFSA should\nupdate the appropriate FAFSA fields and set the <Professional Judgment= indicator. While this is not a PJ, the changes to\nthe FAFSA application system require this work-around to override the IRS-transferred FTI with the manually updated FTI.\nFSA is working on system changes for future application cycles to allow for these updates without setting the <Professional\nJudgment= indicator. See Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-118 for additional information.\nNontax Filers, Foreign Countries, and International Organizations\nIn some countries the tax system does not operate as it does in the U.S., and people in those countries can earn a\nsubstantial amount of income and pay taxes without having to file a return. These individuals should answer <No= to the\nquestion <Did or will the student file a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR?= and <Yes= to the subsequent question to indicate\nthey earned income in a foreign country. While these individuals did not file taxes in the U.S., they are not eligible for an\nautomatic Maximum Pell Grant and must manually enter income and tax information.\nIn some instances, employees of certain international organizations, such as the United Nations, the International\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank, and others, might not be required to file a return. These individuals should answer <No=\nto the question <Did or will the student file a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR?= and <Yes= to the subsequent question to\nindicate they worked for an international organization. Like foreign non-filers described above, these individuals will be\nrequired to manually enter income and tax information, as they are not eligible to receive an automatic Maximum Pell\nGrant as a non-filer.\nIndividuals who earn income in a foreign country or as an employee of an international organization (e.g., World Bank,\nUnited Nations, and International Monetary Fund) and are not required to file a tax return should fill out the FAFSA form in\nthe following way using U.S. dollars:\nFor filing status, select <Single= if you9re single or <Married filing separately= if you9re married.\nFor AGI, include all wages, dividends, capital gains, business income, retirement distributions, and other income on\nwhich you may have paid taxes.\nFor income tax paid, include any income taxes you paid on income in your AGI. If your AGI only shows your net\nincome after paying taxes, enter zero for income tax paid.\nFor income earned from work, enter the income from your AGI that you earned from working at a job (e.g., your",
        "wages and business and farm income) only. This may be the same number as your AGI.\nFiscal Year Tax Returns\nFor a fiscal year (rather than calendar year) tax return, the individual should use information from the return that includes\nthe greater length of time in 2023. For example, an individual who files a fiscal year tax return that begins in September\nwould have two tax returns that overlap the 2023 calendar year 3 September 1, 2022, thru August 31, 2023, (FY23) and\nSeptember 1, 2023, thru August 31, 2024, (FY24). Since the FY23 tax return covers 8 months of the 2023 calendar year\nand the FY24 tax return covers 4 months of the 2023 calendar year, the individual should use the FY23 tax return that\nbegins on September 1, 2022, to complete the FAFSA form.\nNote: There are more days in the year between July 1 and December 31 (184 days) than between January 1 and June 30\n(181, or 182 in a leap year). Keep that in mind when determining the length of time attributed to a fiscal year tax return\nthat begins on July 1.\nStudent 2023 Tax Return Information (20)\nFor U.S. tax filers, much of the information in Question 20 will be transferred directly from the IRS via the FA-DDX.\nHowever, as noted previously, there will be instances where manual entry of tax information will be necessary.\nThis information comes directly from the 2023 federal tax return of the student9s (and the student9s spouse, if married\nand filed jointly with their current spouse). Non-tax filers will not be required to provide this information. The first list\nbelow is data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX, if available. The second list is data elements that the student\nmust enter manually.\nFA-DDX Transferred Data\nFiling status. Single, head of household, married filing jointly, married filing separately, or qualifying surviving\nspouse.\nIncome earned from work. From IRS Form 1040 (or IRS Form 1040-NR): line 1z + Schedule 1: lines 3 + 6.\nTax exempt interest income. From IRS Form 1040: line 2a.\nUntaxed portions of IRA distributions. The filer reports the full amount, including rollovers, of the untaxed\nportion, which is determined from IRS Form 1040: line 4a minus 4b. Rollover amounts are manually entered\nseparately and excluded in the SAI formula calculation.\nUntaxed portions of pensions. The filer reports the full amount, including rollovers, of the untaxed portion, which\nis determined from IRS Form 1040: line 5a minus 5b. Rollover amounts are manually entered separately and\nexcluded in the SAI formula calculation.\nAdjusted gross income. From IRS Form 1040 (or IRS Form 1040-NR): line 11. Amount can be negative.\nIncome tax paid. From IRS Form 1040: line 24\nIRA deductions and payments to self-employed SEP, SIMPLE, and qualified plans.

This question is optional. The student should report only\nthe amount of grants and scholarships received (by the student and the student9s spouse, if applicable) that was\nreported as taxable income on the return. This includes grant and scholarship (not employment) portions of\nfellowships and assistantships, as well as taxable stipends and employer tuition reimbursements. Include AmeriCorps",
        "Applicants Exempt From Asset Reporting\nA dependent student is exempt from asset reporting if they meet one of the following criteria.\n1. The applicant qualifies for a Maximum Pell Grant\n2. The applicant9s parents9 2023 combined AGI is less than $60,000 and they do not file a Schedule A, B, D, E, F, or H,\nAND\na. They do not file a Schedule C, OR\nb. They file a Schedule C with net business income of not more than a $10,000 loss or gain.\n3. The applicant or applicant9s parent received a benefit under a means-tested Federal benefit program during the 2023\nor 2024 calendar year.\nException: A dependent student is not exempt from asset reporting if their parents (1) live outside the U.S. or (2) do not\nfile taxes in the U.S. or a U.S. territory, unless their nonfiling is due to having income below the filing threshold.\nAn independent student is exempt from asset reporting if they meet one of the following criteria.\n1. The applicant qualifies for a Maximum Pell Grant\n2. The applicant9s (and applicant9s spouse, if applicable) 2023 combined AGI is less than $60,000 and they do not file a\nSchedule A, B, D, E, F, or H, AND\na. They do not file a Schedule C, OR\nb. They file a Schedule C with net business income of not more than a $10,000 loss or gain.\n3. The applicant or applicant9s spouse received a benefit under a means-tested federal benefit program during the 2023\nor 2024 calendar year.\nMeans-Tested Federal Benefits Programs\nThe means-tested federal benefit programs are listed in Chapter 2. A person need not have received the benefit for an\nentire year; receiving it at any time in the base or following year qualifies. Also, an FAA may use professional judgment\n(PJ) to count a benefit if a person did not receive it during those 24 months but is receiving it now.\nNo Prorated SAIs\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act does not allow schools to use alternate or prorated SAIs when packaging students for periods\nother than 9 months. Therefore, you should use the calculated SAI to package a student, regardless of the length of time\nof the student9s enrollment.\nThe SAI Worksheets\nThe 2025-26 Student Aid Index (SAI) and Pell Grant Eligibility Guide contains SAI worksheets and tables for each formula\n(A, B and C), which can be used to manually calculate an SAI or to see how the SAI is determined for each of the formulas.\nThe following information provides additional insight into the SAI calculation process and may prove helpful when\nreviewing the SAI worksheets in the 2025-26 Student Aid Index (SAI) and Pell Grant Eligibility Guide.\nFormula A 3 Dependent Students\nThe SAI for a dependent student is calculated using the FAFSA data for the student and their parents. The FPS calculates\nthe parents9 contribution from income and assets, the student9s contribution from income, and the student9s contribution\nfrom assets; the SAI is the sum of these three values.\nParents9 Contribution From Available Income and Assets",
        "Indicators for Schedules A, B, D, E, F, H\nIRS response code\nIn some limited circumstances, the student or contributor may need to manually provide data if it is unavailable through\nthe FA-DDX or does not reflect their current personal circumstances. In these cases, manually entered data will be used in\nthe SAI calculation. For example, a contributor would be required to manually report income and tax data if they were\nmarried and filed their 2023 U.S. tax return jointly with their spouse but are now divorced.\nIRS Response Codes\nThe IRS will provide one of the following response codes for each contributor, and they will appear on a student9s ISIR.\nCode\nIndication\n200\nUsable FTI data retrieved successfully\n214\nNo return on file\n203\n206\n212\nNo usable FTI data retrieved\nThe IRS provides a response code value of <200= when the IRS has data and it was successfully shared with FSA for\ninclusion on the applicant9s FAFSA form. Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler.\nIRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution.\nContributors\n<Contributor= refers to anyone who is required to provide information, consent, and approval, and a signature on the\nFAFSA form. The FAFSA form is organized by contributor. Each contributor will complete their own section of the form\nwhich contains specific questions and instructions pertaining to that contributor. The guidance in this chapter\nsupplements those instructions and explains why some of the questions are needed on the FAFSA form.\nThe following sections discuss the questions found within each contributor section on the FAFSA form. The parents\nmentioned are the legal parents of dependent students. The numbers in parentheses are for the items as they appear on\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary, ISIR, paper (PDF) FAFSA, and FAFSA Partner Portal. The FAFSA form is considered a\n<snapshot= of the family9s information as of the date the application is signed and it can be updated only in certain\ncircumstances and only for certain items. See Chapter 4 for more information about updating a FAFSA form.\nContributor: Student\nThis section consists of 24 questions related to the student.\nStudent Identity Information (1)\nThis question requests the name, date of birth, and Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification\nNumber (ITIN) of the student contributor.

You must also get a signed statement\ngiving the sources and amounts of the person9s income earned from work not found on W-2s. Students may sign on a\nnonfiling spouse9s behalf.\nFor residents of the Freely Associated States, a copy of the wage and tax statement from each employer (substitute for W-\n2s) and a signed statement identifying any other employment income for the year not identified on the wage and tax\nstatement is acceptable. Persons from a U.S. territory, commonwealth, or a foreign country who are not required to file a\ntax return can provide a signed statement, as well as any supporting documentation they might have (e.g., a form\ncomparable to a U.S. W-2), certifying their income.\nThe collection of documentation to verify income earned from work is used to determine if the applicant (and the\napplicable spouse or parent) was required to file a U.S. income tax return (or a return with a relevant tax authority) for the\n2023 tax year. If the individual should have filed but failed to do so, that is conflicting information that you must resolve.\nIf a W-2 is not Available\nIf an individual who is required to submit an IRS Form W-2 did not save a copy, they should request a replacement W-2\nfrom the employer who issued the original. A W-2 transcript from the IRS is also acceptable though it generally is not\navailable until the year after the W-2 information is filed with the IRS (e.g., 2025 for 2023 information filed in 2024). If\nthey are unable to obtain one in a timely manner, you may permit them to provide a signed statement that includes the\nAGI and Income Tax Documentation\n34 CFR 668.57(a)",
        "professional judgment by schools during the award years applicable to the qualifying emergency.\nThe Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, Maximum Pell Grant, and PJ\nThe amount a taxpayer claims as the foreign earned income exclusion counts as untaxed income on the FAFSA form.\nBecause this appears in untaxed income rather than the AGI, it will not be counted when determining students9 eligibility\nfor a maximum Pell Grant. As we noted in Dear Colleague Letter GEN-23-11, there will be a C flag on the ISIR that\nindicates to schools to review how the amount impacts a student9s eligibility for the maximum Pell Grant prior to awarding\naid. As we instructed in our online Q & As (SAI-Q5 and SAI-Q6) FAAs must review eligibility for applicants (and their spouse\nor parent) who reported receiving a foreign earned income exclusion and are eligible for the maximum Pell Grant award. If\nan ISIR contains both a Maximum Pell indicator flag and a valid value in the <Foreign Earned Income Exclusion= data field,\nwe will flag the ISIR for the FAA to review.\nThe FAA will determine4via manual or estimated SAI calculation4if adding the exempted foreign income to the adjusted\ngross income (AGI) would make the student ineligible to receive the maximum Pell Grant award. If that would occur, the\nFAA must determine whether it is appropriate to use PJ to account for the foreign income in determining the student9s\neligibility for the maximum Pell Grant. If the FAA decides that it is appropriate, the FAA may move the foreign earned\nincome amount from untaxed income to AGI or request additional documentation of the foreign income prior to\nperforming the adjustment. If the FAA decides to add the untaxed foreign earned income to the AGI, the FAA must check\nthe PJ flag on the ISIR before submitting the correction.\nRefusing or Reducing a Loan\nFAAs may also use their discretion to refuse or reduce Direct Loan funds if they document the reason, make the\ndetermination on a case-by-case basis, notify the student in writing, and ensure the decision is not due to discrimination\nbased on race, national origin, religion, sex, income, age, or disability.\nUnusual Circumstances\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act provides a clearer directive for FAAs to assist applicants with unusual circumstances to\nadjust dependency status on the FAFSA form to reflect students9 situations more accurately (dependency overrides). Like\nother types of professional judgments, institutions must make students aware of their ability to request an adjustment for\nForeign Earned Income Exclusion PJ Example\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 4: A dependent student9s parent has an overseas business that earns income for\nwhich the parent claims the foreign earned income exclusion on Schedule 1 of their IRS Form 1040. The FAA\nnotices this amount on the ISIR and that the Maximum Pell indicator flag has been set, which means that the FAA\nis required to review the case. The FAA does a manual calculation of the student9s SAI with the amount of the\nexclusion included as AGI rather than as untaxed income. Because the amount is the maximum that could be\nclaimed ($120,000 for tax year 2023, transferring the amount from untaxed income to AGI makes the student\nineligible for an automatic maximum Pell Grant. The FAA decides to use PJ to move the amount of the foreign\nearned income exclusion to the parent9s AGI.\nRefusing or Reducing a Loan\n34 CFR 685.301(a)(8)",

Unborn children should not be included\nin the family size, though the family size can be updated if the child is born and will receive more than half of their\nsupport from the parent (and spouse or partner) during the award year.\nOther persons who live with and receive more than half their support from the parent (and spouse or partner) and\nwill receive more than half support for the entire award year.\nNumber in College (35)\nWhile number in college is no longer used to calculate a student9s SAI, the FAFSA Simplification Act requires the question\nto be included on the FAFSA form. Schools can use the information provided to perform a special circumstance adjustment\nfor a student. See <Professional Judgment= in Chapter 5: Special Cases of this volume for additional information.\nThe student is always included in the number in college. Also included are those in the family size who are or will be\nenrolled at least half time during the award year in a degree or certificate program at a Title IV-eligible school.\nFederal Benefits Received (36)\nA student may be eligible to have their and their parents9 assets excluded from the SAI calculation if they (or someone in\ntheir family) received one (or more) federal benefits during the 2023 or 2024 calendar years. See the <Federal Benefits",
        "Parents9 available income. The parents9 available income is calculated by subtracting certain allowances from the\nparents9 total income. These allowances account for certain nondiscretionary expenses, such as taxes and basic living\nexpenses. Once a minimum level of support has been offset for those expenses, the formula assumes that the remaining\nincome is available for discretionary purposes, including paying for a postsecondary education. The available income can\nbe a negative number.\nThe total income is the sum of the taxable and untaxed income, minus amounts reported in the income but excluded from\nthe formula.\nParents9 taxed/untaxed income. The sum of following items, reported on a U.S. tax return, increases the parents9 total\nincome:\nParents9 AGI\nParents9 deductible payments to self-employed SEP, SIMPLE, Keogh, and other qualified retirement accounts\nTax-exempt interest\nUntaxed IRA/pension distributions (excluding rollovers)\nForeign income exclusion\nParents9 income offsets. The sum of the following items decreases the parents9 total income:\nParents9 taxable college grant and scholarship aid (included as income). This amount is self-reported on the\nFAFSA form.\nParents9 education credits. Use the amount reported on the FAFSA form.\nParents9 Federal Work-Study (FWS). Schools annually report FWS earnings by individual earners to the\nDepartment. ED will then use this information to report FWS on the individual earner9s FAFSA form.\nParents9 income allowances. The sum of the following allowances reduces the parents9 total income:\nU.S. income tax paid. Use the amount reported on the FAFSA form.\nParents9 payroll tax allowance. Use <Table A1:Payroll Tax Allowance= in 2025-26 Student Aid Index (SAI) and Pell\nGrant Eligibility Guide. Apply the rates shown in each step of the table to the total income earned from work in 2023\nfor both parents (as reported on the FAFSA form). The total allowance for payroll taxes is never less than zero.\nIncome protection allowance. Use <Table A2: Income Protection Allowance= in the 2025-26 Student Aid Index\n(SAI) and Pell Grant Eligibility Guide. This allowance is for the basic living expenses of a family. It varies according to\nthe number in the parents9 family size, as reported on the FAFSA form. In general, a school can assume that 30% of\nthe income protection allowance amount is for food, 22% for housing, 9% for transportation expenses, 16% for\nclothing and personal care, 11% for medical care, and 12% for other family consumption.\nEmployment expense allowance. This allowance recognizes extra expenses incurred by families with working\nparents. The maximum allowance is updated annually. See the 2025-26 Student Aid Index (SAI) and Pell Grant\nEligibility Guide for the current year allowance amount. The employment expense allowance is never less than zero.\nParents9 contribution from assets. The full formula uses the assets of parents of a dependent student and determines\na <contribution from assets.= This amount is combined with available income to quantify the family9s financial strength.\nFirst, the parents9 net worth is calculated by adding the following assets reported on the FAFSA form.\nCash, savings, checking, time deposits, and money market funds. Use the amount reported on the FAFSA\nform.\nNet worth of investments. Includes real estate (excluding primary residence), vacation homes, income producing\nproperty, trusts, stocks, bonds, derivatives, securities, mutual funds, tax shelters, and qualified education benefits.\nAdjusted net worth of business and/or investment farm. Use <Table A3: Business/Farm Net Worth Adjustment=\nin the 2025-26 Student Aid Index (SAI) and Pell Grant Eligibility Guide to adjust the total reported on the FAFSA.\nChild support received. Use the amount reported on the FAFSA form. Child support received should be reported as\nthe total amount received in the most recently completed calendar year. For example, if the FAFSA form is\ncompleted in January 2024, the amount of child support received should be the total for the 2023 calendar year.\nSecond, the parents9 discretionary net worth is calculated by subtracting the asset protection allowance (<Table A4:",
        "This question asks if a 2023 IRS Form 1040 or 1040-NR was (or will be) completed. It also asks about income earned in a\nforeign country or if the student spouse filed a tax return in a U.S. territory. See the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)=\nquestion for additional information.\nStudent Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28)\nThis information comes directly from the student spouse9s 2023 tax return. See the discussion of tax return data in the\n<Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX or be\nmanually entered by the student spouse. Unlike the student, the student9s spouse will not be asked to report taxable\ncollege grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits. If the student or spouse had an amount to report, the student should\nhave reported the joint total in the student section. The spouse will also not be asked about receipt of the earned income\ntax credit (EITC). Receipt of the EITC is used to determine if the student (or parent) is a single parent. If the student (or\nparent) is married, they are not a single parent, which makes it unnecessary to ask the spouse about the EITC.\nStudent Spouse Consent, Approval, and Signature (29)\nEvery student spouse contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The student spouse contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the\nIRS.\nApproval 3 The student spouse contributor must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may\nreceive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The student spouse contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their signature on the\nonline FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nMarried, independent students who did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete\nFAFSA ready for submission. The student will receive an email confirmation that the form was submitted. The spouse will\nsee an abbreviated confirmation that the form is complete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide\nan email address will receive email notification when their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA\nSubmission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission\nSummary.\nContributor: Parent\nThis section consists of 12 questions related to the parent of a dependent student.\nDependent students will always have at least one parent contributor. If the student is completing the FAFSA form online,\nthey will be prompted to enter their parent9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and email\naddress) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The parent will be notified by email that they have been invited\nto contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The parent should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and\npassword to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s parent is married\nand filed their 2023 taxes jointly with their current spouse, only one parent contributor is required. If the student9s parent\nis either (1) married or remarried, or (2) unmarried and living together, and did not file their 2023 taxes jointly with their\ncurrent spouse or partner, the parent9s spouse or partner will be a required contributor on the student9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent complete the parent section.\nWho Counts as a Parent on the FAFSA?\nIn most cases, it9s clear who the parents are. A parent is a biological or adoptive parent, or a person that the state has\ndetermined to be a parent (for example, when a state allows another person9s name to be listed as a parent on a birth\ncertificate). A stepparent is considered a parent if married to a biological or adoptive parent and if the student counts\nthem in their family size. Biological and adoptive parents who are unmarried and living together select that as their\nmarital status, and both report their information on the FAFSA form.",
        "from the student9s (and spouse9s) net worth.\nFinally, the student9s (and spouse9s) net worth is multiplied by the conversion rate of 7% to get the student9s\ncontribution from assets. If the contribution from assets is negative, it is set to zero.\nSAI Calculation - Independent Student With Dependents Other Than a\nSpouse\nThis is the final step in determining the student9s SAI. The student9s available income and contribution from assets are\nadded together to determine the student9s adjusted available income, which can be a negative number. The total\nstudent9s contribution from adjusted available income is calculated from the amounts and rates in <Table C6: Assessment\nfrom Adjusted Available Income= in the 2025-26 Student Aid Index (SAI) and Pell Grant Eligibility Guide. The rates in Table\nC6 increase from 22% to 47% as the adjusted available income increases. This is based on the principle that as income\nincreases beyond the amount needed to maintain a basic standard of living, the portion used for family maintenance\ndecreases and the portion available for discretionary purposes increases. Therefore, a progressively larger amount of\nincome may be contributed toward postsecondary educational costs. The number resulting from the assessment\naccording to Table C6 is the student9s SAI and may be negative.",
        "Equivalency Test (HiSET) or the Test Assessing Secondary Completion (TASC), as well as those established by states, for\nexample, the California High School Proficiency Exam (CHSPE). California considers a passing grade on the CHSPE to be\nequivalent to a diploma.\n<None of the previous= includes those who have the recognized equivalent of a high school diploma other than a state-\nrecognized certificate or who may qualify under the Ability-to-Benefit (ATB) alternatives (see Volume 1, Chapter 1 of the\nFSA Handbook for additional information on ATB alternatives).\nIf the student selects <High School Diploma,= they must include the name, city and state (or FC for foreign country) where\nthe student received or will receive their diploma. On the FAFSA website, the student can use city and state to search for\ntheir high school. If they are unable to find their high school using the search functionality, they can manually enter the\nhigh school information. If the student selects <State-recognized high school equivalent,= they must indicate the\nequivalent type (GED, TASC, HiSET, or Other) and the issuing state. See Volume 1, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook,\nregarding a school9s policy about checking the validity of a high school diploma.\nFederal Benefits Received (18)\nA student may be eligible to have their assets excluded from the SAI calculation if they (or someone in their family)\nreceived one (or more) of the following federal benefits during the 2023 or 2024 calendar years.\nEarned income credit (EIC)\nFederal housing assistance\nFree or reduced-price school lunch*\nMedicaid\nRefundable credit for coverage under a qualified health plan (QHP)\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI)\nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)\n*Some individuals may receive free or reduced-price school lunch due to community eligibility rather than household\neligibility. Students should only indicate they received free or reduced-price school lunch on the FAFSA form if they meet\nthe income eligibility guidelines published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nStudent Tax Filing Status (19)\nThis three-part question asks the following:\n1. If the student did (or will) file a 2023 IRS 1040 or 1040-NR.\n2. Whether the student either (1) earned income in a foreign country in 2023, (2) worked for an international\norganization in 2023 and was not required to report income on any tax return, or (3) filed a 2023 tax return in Puerto\nRico or another U.S. territory.\n3. Finally, married students are asked if they filed their 2023 tax return with their current spouse.\nUnmarried students who answer <no= to the first two parts of the question are considered non-tax filers and, if\nindependent, do not need to answer any additional questions about income or assets. Married students who answer <no=\nto the first two parts of the question will still need to provide identity and contact information about their spouse.\nRecognized Equivalent of a High School Diploma\n34 CFR 600.2"

      "question": "How should a student report taxable grants and scholarships on the FAFSA, and what role does IRS Form 1040 Schedule 1 play in this process?",
      "response": "A student should report taxable grants and scholarships on the FAFSA by including only those amounts that were reported as taxable income on their 2023 federal tax return. Specifically, the student should report taxable grants, scholarships, and AmeriCorps benefits that were included as income on their IRS Form 1040 or 1040-NR.\n\nThe role of IRS Form 1040 Schedule 1 in this process is to provide information for certain taxable income items that are not directly transferred via the data retrieval tool. Specifically, Schedule 1, lines 3 and 6, report income such as taxable grants and scholarships, and these amounts are transferred into the FAFSA through the IRS data transfer process when available. If this information is successfully imported, the FAFSA will automatically include the taxable portion of grants and scholarships based on what was reported on Schedule 1.\n\nIn cases where the IRS data retrieval system does not transfer this information, the student or the financial aid administrator must manually enter the taxable grant and scholarship amount into the FAFSA form. This ensures the accurate calculation of the Student Aid Index (SAI) and eligibility for aid.\n\nIn summary:\n- Report taxable grants and scholarships only if they are reported as taxable income on the 2023 tax return.\n- IRS Form 1040 Schedule 1 plays a key role by providing specific data elements, including taxable grant and scholarship income, which can be transferred automatically to the FAFSA.\n- If automatic transfer is unavailable, manual entry is required.\n\nLet me know if you'd like further clarification!",

This may be the same number as your AGI.\nFiscal Year Tax Returns\nFor a fiscal year (rather than calendar year) tax return, the individual should use information from the return that includes\nthe greater length of time in 2023. For example, an individual who files a fiscal year tax return that begins in September\nwould have two tax returns that overlap the 2023 calendar year 3 September 1, 2022, thru August 31, 2023, (FY23) and\nSeptember 1, 2023, thru August 31, 2024, (FY24). Since the FY23 tax return covers 8 months of the 2023 calendar year\nand the FY24 tax return covers 4 months of the 2023 calendar year, the individual should use the FY23 tax return that\nbegins on September 1, 2022, to complete the FAFSA form.\nNote: There are more days in the year between July 1 and December 31 (184 days) than between January 1 and June 30\n(181, or 182 in a leap year). Keep that in mind when determining the length of time attributed to a fiscal year tax return\nthat begins on July 1.\nStudent 2023 Tax Return Information (20)\nFor U.S. tax filers, much of the information in Question 20 will be transferred directly from the IRS via the FA-DDX.\nHowever, as noted previously, there will be instances where manual entry of tax information will be necessary.\nThis information comes directly from the 2023 federal tax return of the student9s (and the student9s spouse, if married\nand filed jointly with their current spouse). Non-tax filers will not be required to provide this information. The first list\nbelow is data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX, if available. The second list is data elements that the student\nmust enter manually.\nFA-DDX Transferred Data\nFiling status. Single, head of household, married filing jointly, married filing separately, or qualifying surviving\nspouse.\nIncome earned from work. From IRS Form 1040 (or IRS Form 1040-NR): line 1z + Schedule 1: lines 3 + 6.\nTax exempt interest income. From IRS Form 1040: line 2a.\nUntaxed portions of IRA distributions. The filer reports the full amount, including rollovers, of the untaxed\nportion, which is determined from IRS Form 1040: line 4a minus 4b. Rollover amounts are manually entered\nseparately and excluded in the SAI formula calculation.\nUntaxed portions of pensions. The filer reports the full amount, including rollovers, of the untaxed portion, which\nis determined from IRS Form 1040: line 5a minus 5b. Rollover amounts are manually entered separately and\nexcluded in the SAI formula calculation.\nAdjusted gross income. From IRS Form 1040 (or IRS Form 1040-NR): line 11. Amount can be negative.\nIncome tax paid. From IRS Form 1040: line 24\nIRA deductions and payments to self-employed SEP, SIMPLE, and qualified plans. From IRS Form 1040\nSchedule 1: total of lines 16 + 20.\nEducation credits. Includes American Opportunity (AOTC) and Lifetime Learning (LLC) credits. From IRS\nForm 1040: line 29 + IRS Form 1040 Schedule 3: line 3.\nSchedules filed. Did the tax filer file a Schedule A, B, D, E, F, or H?\nNet business profit or loss.

This question is optional. The student should report only\nthe amount of grants and scholarships received (by the student and the student9s spouse, if applicable) that was\nreported as taxable income on the return. This includes grant and scholarship (not employment) portions of\nfellowships and assistantships, as well as taxable stipends and employer tuition reimbursements. Include AmeriCorps",
        "2. The disclosure of their FTI by the IRS to the Department;\n3. The use of their FTI by a Department official to determine an applicant9s eligibility for federal student aid and the\namount for which they are eligible; and\n4. The redisclosure of FTI by the Department to an eligible institution, state higher education agency, or a designated\nscholarship organization (e.g., institutional or state financial aid).\nOnly the Department has the authority to obtain approval and consent for the use and disclosure of FTI for such purposes.\nOur partners (FAAs, advocates, etc.) are not permitted to obtain approval and consent on behalf of FAFSA contributors\n(including parent(s) or spouse) for the use and disclosure of FTI.\nOnce a FAFSA contributor has provided consent and approval for use and disclosure of FTI for a FAFSA cycle (e.g., the\n2025-26 FAFSA cycle), they cannot revoke consent for that cycle. The ability to revoke consent is not needed for FAFSA\npurposes because the FAFSA contributor is providing a one-time consent for a specific tax year and an annual consent is\nrequired for each FAFSA cycle.\nStudents and contributors are not able to view or edit the imported FTI data. This is to enhance security, privacy, and to\nreduce the risk of the misuse of sensitive data. However, you (the financial aid administrator) will be able to see the\ntransferred data on the ISIR. Schools and other partners that receive ISIRs must protect federal student aid information\nprovided to them by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the application, award, and administration of the\nfederal student aid programs as permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA, as amended. In keeping with the\nexpectation that you protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, you must not disclose FTI\nfrom the FAFSA form unless the disclosure and use is permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA 1098h. For additional\ninformation and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34.\nSignatures\nEach student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS\nand (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per\napplication cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a\nprocessed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is\naccurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction\nto contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating\nthat the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their\nFAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect\nthe necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature\nrequirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval. Only the Department can collect a contributor9s\nconsent and approval.\nFederal Tax Information\nThe following data received by the Department from the IRS are considered FTI:\nTax Year (ex. Award year 2025-26 is based on 2023 tax year information from the IRS)\nTax Filing Status\nAdjusted Gross Income (AGI)\nNumber of Exemptions and Number of Dependents\nIncome Earned from Work\nTaxes Paid\nEducational Credits\nUntaxed IRA distributions\nIRA deductions and payments\nTax exempt interest\nUntaxed pension amounts\nSchedule C net profit/loss",

For example, if IRS Form 1040,\nline 1z is $50,000 and Schedule 1, line 3 is -$10,000, the income earned from work value should be $50,000.\nUsing the Tax Transcript\nIf applicants or contributors are unable to transfer data via the FA-DDX, the student, spouse, and/or parents, as\napplicable, can use an IRS tax return transcript to document information from the tax return. Before requesting a\ntranscript, they should allow enough time to pass after filing the return; it takes the IRS two to four weeks to process\nreturns filed electronically and six to eight weeks for mailed returns. Tax transcripts submitted to your school for\nverification do not need to be signed by the tax filer (but it is encouraged) unless you have reason to doubt their\nauthenticity.\nThere are a few ways to request a tax return transcript. The IRS provides instructions on all options at\nwww.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript. Per the IRS, the fastest and easiest way is to access personal tax records online,\nwhich allows the tax filer to get a real-time, electronic transcript. Tax filers who opt to request transcripts by mail or\nphone will receive a mailed transcript in return. Schools can accept and copy transcripts originally obtained from the IRS.\nThe IRS9s Income Verification Express Service (IVES) allows a third party to request and receive a tax filer9s transcript. The\nIVES participant submits a 4506-C form, signed by the tax filer, and receives the transcript from the IRS, which charges a\nsmall fee for the service. Schools may apply to participate in IVES. They may also use a transcript from another IVES\nparticipant (which is not considered a third-party servicer in this case) for verification if they have no reason to doubt its\nauthenticity. Schools may not pass on the charge for using this service to the student.\nTo combat identity theft, the IRS masks much of the personally identifiable information on the transcript. For example,\nonly the last four digits of any SSN or account or telephone number are displayed. When requesting a transcript,\ntaxpayers will be prompted to create a <customer file number= which appears on a requested transcript to help facilitate\nidentification. This can be something like a student9s college ID number or some other number (but not an SSN). See the\nOctober 4, 2018, announcement and the IRS news release for more information.\nEach year the Department provides a tax return transcript matrix to assist schools with reviewing tax data. Specifically,\nthe tax return transcript matrix consists of a chart of the FAFSA and ISIR tax items used for verification and their\ncorresponding line items from the various IRS tax returns and the tax transcript for the appropriate award year. At the\ntime the 2025-26 Application and Verification Guide was published, the 2023 tax return transcript matrix had not been",
        "Indicators for Schedules A, B, D, E, F, H\nIRS response code\nIn some limited circumstances, the student or contributor may need to manually provide data if it is unavailable through\nthe FA-DDX or does not reflect their current personal circumstances. In these cases, manually entered data will be used in\nthe SAI calculation. For example, a contributor would be required to manually report income and tax data if they were\nmarried and filed their 2023 U.S. tax return jointly with their spouse but are now divorced.\nIRS Response Codes\nThe IRS will provide one of the following response codes for each contributor, and they will appear on a student9s ISIR.\nCode\nIndication\n200\nUsable FTI data retrieved successfully\n214\nNo return on file\n203\n206\n212\nNo usable FTI data retrieved\nThe IRS provides a response code value of <200= when the IRS has data and it was successfully shared with FSA for\ninclusion on the applicant9s FAFSA form. Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler.\nIRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution.\nContributors\n<Contributor= refers to anyone who is required to provide information, consent, and approval, and a signature on the\nFAFSA form. The FAFSA form is organized by contributor. Each contributor will complete their own section of the form\nwhich contains specific questions and instructions pertaining to that contributor. The guidance in this chapter\nsupplements those instructions and explains why some of the questions are needed on the FAFSA form.\nThe following sections discuss the questions found within each contributor section on the FAFSA form. The parents\nmentioned are the legal parents of dependent students. The numbers in parentheses are for the items as they appear on\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary, ISIR, paper (PDF) FAFSA, and FAFSA Partner Portal. The FAFSA form is considered a\n<snapshot= of the family9s information as of the date the application is signed and it can be updated only in certain\ncircumstances and only for certain items. See Chapter 4 for more information about updating a FAFSA form.\nContributor: Student\nThis section consists of 24 questions related to the student.\nStudent Identity Information (1)\nThis question requests the name, date of birth, and Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification\nNumber (ITIN) of the student contributor. The name, with other identifying information, is used for several data matches.",
        "Dependent students who answer <no= to the first to parts of the question will still need to provide answers to questions\nabout their assets if their parents are required to provide financial information.\nIndependent students are automatically eligible for a Maximum Pell Grant if they (and their spouse, if married) are not\nrequired to file a 2023 federal tax return. Such students will be assigned an SAI of -1,500 and will not be required to\nprovide any further financial information on the FAFSA form.\nIndividuals who were married and filed jointly with the IRS and are no longer married to the spouse on the applicable tax\nreturn, and/or who have married a different spouse, will be required to manually enter their income and tax information.\nSee the <Joint Return Filers Who Are No Longer Married= section in Chapter 4 for additional information on separating tax\nreturn and income information.\nIndividuals who only file foreign tax returns will also be unable to use the FA-DDX since it does not link to foreign tax\nauthorities. They will instead need to manually input their income and tax data by converting foreign currency to U.S.\ndollars and entering the resulting amounts in the comparable fields from U.S. tax returns.\nPuerto Rico and Other U.S. Territory Residents\nSome individuals who reside in Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory may use an IRS Form 1040 or 1040-NR but file their\ntaxes with their local tax authority, not the IRS. These individuals should answer <No= to the question <Did or will the\nstudent file a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR?= and <Yes= to the subsequent question to indicate they filed a tax return\nwith Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory.\nAdditionally, some individuals who live and work in Puerto Rico may file two tax returns 3 one with the IRS and one with\nthe Puerto Rico tax authority. If they are filing electronically and FTI is available via the FA-DDX, only their tax information\nfiled with the IRS will be imported to the FAFSA form. They will not be able to manually enter the information from their\ntax return filed with Puerto Rico. If the FAA is aware of this dual filing scenario, the FAA should evaluate the applicant9s\ninformation and determine if the information from the Puerto Rico tax return should replace the information imported\nfrom the IRS. FAAs who determine that the information from the Puerto Rico tax return should be on the FAFSA should\nupdate the appropriate FAFSA fields and set the <Professional Judgment= indicator. While this is not a PJ, the changes to\nthe FAFSA application system require this work-around to override the IRS-transferred FTI with the manually updated FTI.\nFSA is working on system changes for future application cycles to allow for these updates without setting the <Professional\nJudgment= indicator. See Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-118 for additional information.\nNontax Filers, Foreign Countries, and International Organizations\nIn some countries the tax system does not operate as it does in the U.S., and people in those countries can earn a\nsubstantial amount of income and pay taxes without having to file a return. These individuals should answer <No= to the\nquestion <Did or will the student file a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR?= and <Yes= to the subsequent question to indicate\nthey earned income in a foreign country. While these individuals did not file taxes in the U.S., they are not eligible for an\nautomatic Maximum Pell Grant and must manually enter income and tax information.\nIn some instances, employees of certain international organizations, such as the United Nations, the International\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank, and others, might not be required to file a return. These individuals should answer <No=\nto the question <Did or will the student file a 2023 IRS form 1040 or 1040-NR?= and <Yes= to the subsequent question to\nindicate they worked for an international organization. Like foreign non-filers described above, these individuals will be\nrequired to manually enter income and tax information, as they are not eligible to receive an automatic Maximum Pell\nGrant as a non-filer.\nIndividuals who earn income in a foreign country or as an employee of an international organization (e.g., World Bank,\nUnited Nations, and International Monetary Fund) and are not required to file a tax return should fill out the FAFSA form in\nthe following way using U.S. dollars:\nFor filing status, select <Single= if you9re single or <Married filing separately= if you9re married.\nFor AGI, include all wages, dividends, capital gains, business income, retirement distributions, and other income on\nwhich you may have paid taxes.\nFor income tax paid, include any income taxes you paid on income in your AGI. If your AGI only shows your net\nincome after paying taxes, enter zero for income tax paid.\nFor income earned from work, enter the income from your AGI that you earned from working at a job (e.g., your",
        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3.\nThe easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported. However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form.\nFUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form.\nConsent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper).\nTo provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department.\nFAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",
        "The ISIR will only display the federal school code of the receiving school. The information of other schools the student\nincluded on the FAFSA form will not appear except on the FAFSA Submission Summary and on ISIRs sent to state grant\nagencies. See Volume 6 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specification Guide.\nStudent Consent, Approval, and Signature (24)\nEvery student must provide the following to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The student must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the IRS.\nApproval 3 The student must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may receive, use, and\nredisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The student9s FSA ID (account username and password) will serve as their signature on the online\nFAFSA form. Paper (PDF) FAFSA form filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nIn addition to certifying that the data on the FAFSA form is correct, the student is also signing a statement of educational\npurpose, which is required to receive Title IV funds. Among other things, the student agrees to spend Title IV funds only\non educational expenses and affirms that they are not in default on a federal loan and do not owe a grant overpayment.\nFAFSA Submission\nStudents who do not have any other required contributors now have a complete FAFSA form. Students who complete and\nsubmit their FAFSA form online will receive an email version of their confirmation page. When the applicant9s FAFSA form\nis processed, students who provided an email address will receive an email notification of processing with instructions to\naccess their FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their\nFAFSA Submission Summary. Applicants with additional required contributors will need these individuals to contribute to\ntheir FAFSA form, as described next.\nContributor: Student Spouse\nThis section consists of five questions related to the student9s spouse. The student9s spouse is a required contributor on\nthe FAFSA form if the student is married and did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse.\nIf a married student is completing the FAFSA form online and the student9s spouse is identified as a required contributor,\nthe student will be prompted to enter their spouse9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and\nemail address) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The student spouse will be notified by email that they\nhave been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The spouse should use their own StudentAid.gov account\nusername and password to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s\nspouse is not a required contributor, the student will enter the same identifying information and email address, but the\nstudent9s spouse will not be invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their spouse complete the student spouse\ncontributor section.\nStudent Spouse Identity Information (25)\nLike the student, the student spouse identity information should match what appears on their social security card. If the\nstudent spouse does not have a Social Security number and is completing their section of the form online, the SSN field\nwill be blank, based on their StudentAid.gov account information. If they are completing their section on the paper (PDF)\nFAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field. In both application methods, the student spouse should enter their\nITIN, if they have one, in the ITIN field.\nStudent Spouse Contact Information (26)\nThis is the student spouse9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address.\nStudent Spouse Tax Filing Status (27)",
        "reconcile the conflicting information and take appropriate action under the specific program requirements (depending on\nthe outcome, funds may have to be returned).\nSubsequent ISIRs\nYou are generally required to review all subsequent transactions for a student for the entire processing year even if you\nverified an earlier transaction. An exception to this requirement is if a later transaction comes in after the student is no\nlonger enrolled at your institution. Review the SAI, C flag, or verification tracking group for changes. Review new\ncomments or NSLDS information that impacts eligibility for aid. Check any updates or corrections. If the SAI has not\nchanged and there are no changes in the C flag, verification tracking group, or NSLDS information, no action is generally\nrequired. If the SAI does change but it either doesn9t affect the amount and type of aid received or the data elements that\nchanged were already verified, no action is required. But if the SAI changes and the pertinent data elements were not\nverified, then you must investigate. Of course, any time the C flag changes or NSLDS data have been modified, you must\nresolve any conflicts.\nDiscrepant Tax Data\nFinancial aid administrators do not need to be tax experts, but there are some issues that even a layperson with basic tax\nlaw information can evaluate. Because conflicting data often involve such information, FAAs must have a fundamental\nunderstanding of relevant tax issues that can impact the need analysis. You are obligated to know (1) whether a person\nwas required to file a tax return and (2) what the correct filing status for a person should be. The IRS9s online Interactive\nTax Assistant can help with these and other issues by walking the user through a series of questions. IRS Publication 17 is\nalso a useful resource.\nResolution of Conflicting Information\nYou must resolve conflicting information prior to disbursing aid to a student enrolled at your school. Even if the conflict\nconcerns a previous award year, you must still investigate it. You have resolved the matter when you have\ndetermined which data are correct; this might simply be confirming that an earlier determination was the right one. You\nmust document your findings and include an explanation that justifies your decision.\nThe verification page on the FSA Assessments site has guidance to help you review your conflicting information\nprocedures; see Activity 1.\nReferral of Fraud Cases\nRequirement to Verify Questionable Data\n34 CFR 668.54(a)(2)\nDiscrepant Tax Data Example\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 7: An FAA notices that a dependent student9s parents, who are married and live\ntogether, have each filed as head of household (which offers a greater tax deduction than filing as single or\nmarried). The FAA must ask if that is the right status. Resolution of the conflict could be the parents refiling and\nsubmitting a copy of the amended return or a reasonable explanation of why there is no conflict under IRS rules.",
        "essentially a savings account, and its value as an asset is the current balance of the account.\nCoverdell education savings accounts, or ESAs, are another tax-advantaged savings vehicle for college education. They\nare treated the same as college savings plans: the current balance is an asset of the account owner.\nIf distributions from QTPs and ESAs do not exceed the qualified education expenses for which they are intended, they are\ntax-free, so they will not appear in the next year9s AGI. They should not be treated as other financial assistance (OFA). For\nmore information on these benefits, see the IRS9s Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education.\nRental properties are an asset. A unit within a family home that has its own entrance, kitchen, and bath (therefore a\nrented bedroom would not count) and that is rented to someone other than a family member counts as an asset. To\ncalculate its net value, multiply the net value of the entire structure by the fraction the rented space represents. Similarly,\nif a family owned a 10-unit apartment building and lived in one of the apartments, 9/10 or 90% of the net value of the\nbuilding would be an asset.\nTake-back mortgage value should be reported as an asset. In a take-back mortgage, the seller of a house finances a\nportion of its cost for the buyer, who repays this additional mortgage to the seller. The seller reports the interest part of\nany payments received from the buyer on Schedule B of IRS Form 1040. Therefore, if such interest is reported on a tax\nreturn, it likely indicates an asset that should be reported on the FAFSA form: the value of the take-back mortgage. There\nwould be no debt reported against this asset. For example, if an individual sold their house for $200,000 and financed a\ntake back mortgage of $40,000 to the buyer, the seller should report $40,000 as the net worth of the investment. The\nworth will decrease each year depending on how much of the principal the buyer paid back that year. This concept applies\nto other forms of seller financing of the sale of a home or other property.\nVirtual currency (or cryptocurrency) such as Bitcoin is considered an asset. The value (in U.S. dollars as of the day the\nFAFSA form is completed) of virtual currency must be reported on the FAFSA form. If the owner sells virtual currency and\nhas a capital gain from the sale, the taxable portion will be in the AGI for the year it is reported on the tax return, and the\nAGI will then be included on the associated FAFSA form. For more information on how the IRS treats virtual currencies,\nplease see the IRS virtual currency webpage.\nUniform Gifts and Uniform Transfers to Minors Acts (UGMA and UTMA) allow the establishment of an account for\ngifts of cash and financial assets for a minor without the expense of creating a trust. Because the minor is the owner of\nthe account, it counts as the minor9s asset on the FAFSA form, not the asset of the custodian, who is often the parent.\nTrust funds are considered an asset of the named beneficiary of the trust, even if the beneficiary9s access to the trust is\nrestricted. If the settlor of a trust has voluntarily placed restrictions on its use, then the beneficiary should report its\npresent value as an asset, as discussed below. If a trust has been restricted by court order, however, the beneficiary\nshould not report it. An example of such a restricted trust is one set up by court order to pay for future surgery for the\nvictim of a car accident.\nHow the trust must be reported depends on whether the beneficiary receives or will receive the interest income, the trust\nprincipal, or both. In the case of a divorce or separation where the trust is owned jointly and ownership is not being\ncontested, the property and the debt are equally divided between the owners for reporting purposes unless the terms of\nthe trust specify some other method of division.\nIf a beneficiary receives interest only from the trust, any interest received in the base year must be reported as income.\nIf the interest accumulates and is not paid out, the recipient must report an asset value for the interest they will receive.\nThe trust officer can usually calculate the value of the interest the person will receive while the trust exists. This value\nrepresents the amount a third person would be willing to pay for the interest income.\nThe person who will receive principal only from the trust must report the present value of his or her right to that\nprincipal as an asset. For example, if a $10,000 principal reverts to a student9s parent when the trust ends in ten years\nand the student is receiving the interest, the student would report the interest received as income and the present value\nof the student9s parent9s rights to the principal is reported as an asset of the parent (if the student is required to report\nparental data) on the student9s FAFSA form. The present value of the principal can be calculated by the trust officer; it9s\nthe amount that a third person would pay for the right to receive the principal ten years from now4basically, the amount\nthat one would have to deposit now to receive $10,000 in ten years.\nIf a beneficiary receives both interest and principal from the trust, the beneficiary should report the present value of",
        "Received (18)= question for a list of these federal benefits.\nParent Tax Filing Status (37)\nThis question asks if the parent filed (or will file) a 2023 IRS 1040 or 1040-NR. If the answer is <no=, the parent will be\nasked to select one of the following reasons for not filing:\n1. The parent filed or will file a tax return with Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory.\n2. The parent filed or will file a foreign tax return.\n3. The parent either earned income in a foreign country but did not and will not file a foreign tax return, or worked for\nan international organization and was not required to report income on any tax return.\n4. The parent, even though they earned income in the U.S., did not and will not file a U.S. tax return because their\nincome was below the filing threshold.\n5. The parent did not and will not file a U.S. tax return for reasons other than low income.\n6. The parent did not and will not file any tax return because they did not earn any income or they were not required to\nfile under the Internal Revenue Code.\nThe purpose of these questions is to determine if a parent was either (1) required to file a 2023 U.S. federal tax return and\ndid not or (2) has income from a foreign country that must be manually entered on the FAFSA form.\nA dependent student will be automatically eligible for a Maximum Pell Grant if their parent (and parent9s spouse or\npartner) is subject to the U.S. Tax Code but is not required to file a 2023 U.S. federal tax return. The student will be\nassigned an SAI of -1,500 and will not be required to provide any further financial information on the FAFSA form.\nFinally, married parents are asked if they filed their 2023 tax return with their current spouse. Individuals who were\nmarried and filed jointly with the IRS and are no longer married to the spouse on the applicable tax return, or who have\nmarried a different spouse, will be required to manually enter their income and tax information. See the <Joint Return\nFilers Who Are No Longer Married= section in Chapter 4 for additional information on separating tax return and income\ninformation.\nIndividuals who only file foreign tax returns will also be unable to use the FA-DDX since it does not link to foreign tax\nauthorities. They will instead need to manually input their income and tax data by converting foreign currency to U.S.\ndollars and entering the resulting amounts in the comparable fields from U.S. tax returns. See the <Student Tax Filing\nStatus (19)= question for additional information.\nIf the parent indicates they earned income in a foreign country but did not file a foreign tax return, or worked for an\ninternational organization, such as the United Nations, World Bank, or International Monetary Fund (option 3), they will\nneed to manually input their income and tax data, similar to individuals who file foreign tax returns. See <Non-tax filers,\nforeign countries, and international organizations= under <Student Tax Filing Status (19)= for additional guidance.\nIf a parent indicates they did not file a U.S. tax return for reasons other than low income (option 5), you should treat this\nas conflicting information and request documentation to resolve it, which may include requiring the individual to file a tax\nreturn and present sufficient documentation of filing to you.\nIf a parent indicates they did not file any tax return because they did not earn any income (option 6) and their state of\nlegal residence is a foreign country, you must determine if the parent has foreign untaxed income that, when included in\nthe SAI calculation, impacts a student9s Pell Grant eligibility. Comment code 303 on the student9s ISIR should prompt you\nto request additional documentation. If your inquiry into the parents9 financial situation shows that the student might be\neligible for less or no Pell grant funds, you may use PJ to account for the parents9 untaxed income and assets, similar to\nthe action you might take when there is a substantial foreign earned income exclusion on a U.S. tax return that can affect\na student9s Pell eligibility.\nParent 2023 Tax Return Information (38)\nFor U.S. tax filers, much of the information in Question 38 will be transferred directly from the IRS via the FA-DDX.",
        "This question asks if a 2023 IRS Form 1040 or 1040-NR was (or will be) completed. It also asks about income earned in a\nforeign country or if the student spouse filed a tax return in a U.S. territory. See the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)=\nquestion for additional information.\nStudent Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28)\nThis information comes directly from the student spouse9s 2023 tax return. See the discussion of tax return data in the\n<Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX or be\nmanually entered by the student spouse. Unlike the student, the student9s spouse will not be asked to report taxable\ncollege grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits. If the student or spouse had an amount to report, the student should\nhave reported the joint total in the student section. The spouse will also not be asked about receipt of the earned income\ntax credit (EITC). Receipt of the EITC is used to determine if the student (or parent) is a single parent. If the student (or\nparent) is married, they are not a single parent, which makes it unnecessary to ask the spouse about the EITC.\nStudent Spouse Consent, Approval, and Signature (29)\nEvery student spouse contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The student spouse contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the\nIRS.\nApproval 3 The student spouse contributor must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may\nreceive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The student spouse contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their signature on the\nonline FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nMarried, independent students who did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete\nFAFSA ready for submission. The student will receive an email confirmation that the form was submitted. The spouse will\nsee an abbreviated confirmation that the form is complete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide\nan email address will receive email notification when their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA\nSubmission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission\nSummary.\nContributor: Parent\nThis section consists of 12 questions related to the parent of a dependent student.\nDependent students will always have at least one parent contributor. If the student is completing the FAFSA form online,\nthey will be prompted to enter their parent9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and email\naddress) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The parent will be notified by email that they have been invited\nto contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The parent should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and\npassword to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s parent is married\nand filed their 2023 taxes jointly with their current spouse, only one parent contributor is required. If the student9s parent\nis either (1) married or remarried, or (2) unmarried and living together, and did not file their 2023 taxes jointly with their\ncurrent spouse or partner, the parent9s spouse or partner will be a required contributor on the student9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent complete the parent section.\nWho Counts as a Parent on the FAFSA?\nIn most cases, it9s clear who the parents are. A parent is a biological or adoptive parent, or a person that the state has\ndetermined to be a parent (for example, when a state allows another person9s name to be listed as a parent on a birth\ncertificate). A stepparent is considered a parent if married to a biological or adoptive parent and if the student counts\nthem in their family size. Biological and adoptive parents who are unmarried and living together select that as their\nmarital status, and both report their information on the FAFSA form.",
        "both interest and principal, as described in the discussion of principal only. If the trust is set up so that the interest\naccumulates within the trust until it ends, the beneficiary should report the present value of the interest and principal that\nthey are expected to receive when the trust ends as an asset.\nIn some cases, ownership of an asset may be divided or contested, which can affect how the owner reports the asset. If\nthe owner has only part ownership of an asset, the owner should report only the owned part. Generally, the value of an\nasset and debts against it should be divided equally by the number of people who share ownership unless the share of the\nasset is determined by the amount invested or the terms of the arrangement specify some other means of division.\nIf ownership is contested, the asset should not be reported on the FAFSA form. For instance, if a couple is separated\nand can9t sell or borrow against jointly owned property because it9s being contested, the net worth of the property would\nnot be reported as an asset. If ownership of an asset is resolved after the initial application is filed, the value cannot be\nupdated. If there9s a lien against the asset, the net value of the asset is determined by subtracting any associated debt\nand the amount of the lien from its total value. If foreclosure of an asset is imminent, the net value of the asset would still\nbe reported until the party making the foreclosure completes legal action to take possession of the asset. If the status of\nthe property changes after the application is filed, the value cannot be updated.\nExcluded Assets\nThe following are excluded assets and should not be reported on the FAFSA form:\nPossessions such as a car for personal use, a sound system, clothes, or furniture.\nA family9s principal place of residence, even if it is part of a business or farm property.\nRetirement and life insurance plans and ABLE accounts. An ABLE account is a tax-advantaged savings account\nfor a disabled person and their family; its value does not count as an asset on the FAFSA form. The value of\nretirement plans4401(k) plans, pension funds, annuities, noneducation IRAs, Keogh plans, etc.4also is not counted\nas an asset, but distributions do count as income. An exception to reporting pension distributions is when they are\nrolled over into another retirement plan in the same tax year (rollover). Similarly, the cash value or equity of a whole\nlife insurance policy isn9t reported as an asset, but an insurance settlement may count as income if it is included in\nthe student9s AGI.\nExcluded assets for Native American students. The law excludes reporting any income and asset of $2,000 or\nless per individual payment (any amount over $2,000 is reported as an asset of the recipient) received under the Per\nCapita Act or the Indian Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act. It also excludes any income received under\nthe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act or the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. Per capita distributions or the\nproceeds received from the Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations4a tribal purchase of fractionated lands\nbecause of the Cobell settlement under the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 1305)4should also be excluded.\nColleges (23)\nFor a school to be able to receive the student's data, the student must list the college9s federal school code (not the OPE\nID) or enter its complete name, address, city, and state. There is a federal school code search in the online FAFSA form,\nand the entire list of school codes is available as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and an Adobe PDF document on the\nKnowledge Center website under the Library section9s <Publications by Resource Type= area.\nThe student can list up to 10 schools on the paper (PDF) FAFSA form and 20 on the web (at least one school is required). If\na student wants their information to be available to more schools, they can change the schools listed online or use their\nFAFSA Submission Summary. The FPS will send data to no more than 20 (10 with the PDF FAFSA form) schools at a time.\nChapter 4 explains how students can add or change schools.\nExcluded assets for Native American Students\nHEA Sec. 479C",

These\nbenefits count as other financial assistance (or reduce the cost of attendance) even if they aren9t received until the\nend of the class(es) and are contingent on earning a minimum grade. Any taxable portion should be included in this\nfield.\nForeign earned income exclusion. From IRS Form 1040 Schedule 1: line 8d. This amount is typically a negative\nvalue on the tax return. The SAI formula will consider the absolute value of any negative value reported.\nAnnual Child Support Received (21)\nAnnual child support received is included as an asset of the recipient in the SAI formula. If an independent student (and\ntheir spouse, if married) received child support in the last complete calendar year, they should enter the total amount\nreceived for all children in the family size in this question.\nStudent Assets (22)\nAn asset is property that the family owns and has an exchange value. The FAFSA form collects current data (as of the day\nthe FAFSA form is signed) about cash, savings and checking accounts; investments and real estate; and businesses and\ninvestment farms.\nMost assets are investments such as qualified education benefits or savings accounts, Coverdell education savings\naccounts, real estate, installment and land sale contracts (including mortgages held), trust funds, mutual funds, money\nmarket funds, Uniform Gifts and Uniform Transfers to Minors (UGMA and UTMA) accounts, certificates of deposit, stocks,\nstock options, bonds, commodities, and precious metals. If the asset isn9t a business or farm, it is reported as an\ninvestment.\nThe FAFSA form asks for the net worth of investments, which is their total current market value minus their associated\ndebts. If their net worth is negative, zero should be reported.\nApplicants will be asked to report the net worth of all businesses and farms, regardless of the size of the enterprise,\nlocation of the family9s residence on the property, or number of employees. The current net worth (the current market\nvalue minus the debt owed on it) is reported for land, buildings, machinery, equipment, livestock, unharvested crops, and\ninventories. However, the value of a family9s primary residence is still excluded, even if the residence is on the farm\nproperty or used to run the business. Applicants should determine the total net value of all farm assets and subtract the\nnet value of their principal residence to determine the final value of their farm assets. The principal residence may include\nthe family9s home, as well as structures and land adjacent to the home that are not being used, stored, or sold for farming\nor other commercial activities. Property values are generally assessed at a rate that considers the use of the property and\nthe value of the land. Applicants and their families may refer to their property tax assessments from municipal, county, or\nstate governments to help determine and separate the value of their principal residence from other property.\nQualified education benefits or education savings accounts include Coverdell savings accounts, 529 college\nsavings plans, and the refund value of 529 prepaid tuition plans. For an independent student, the accounts owned by the\nstudent (and/or the student9s spouse) are reported as student investments. For a dependent student, an account is\nreported as a parental investment if the account is designated for the dependent student (accounts designated for other\nchildren in the family are not included). If the student is the beneficiary (but not the owner) of the account, the value is\nnot reported as a student asset.\nStates, their agencies, and some colleges sponsor qualified tuition programs (QTPs). The IRS mentions two types of\nQTPs that are commonly called prepaid tuition plans and college savings plans. States may offer both types, but colleges\nmay only sponsor prepaid tuition plans.\nPrepaid tuition plans allow a person to buy tuition credits or certificates, which count as units of attendance. The number\nof units doesn9t change even though tuition will likely increase before the beneficiary uses the tuition credits. They are an\nasset of the plan owner, and their worth is the refund value of the credits or certificates.\nCollege savings plans allow a benefactor to deposit money into an account that will be used for the beneficiary9s college\nexpenses. The buyer does not pre-purchase tuition credits as with a prepaid tuition plan. Rather, this type of plan is",

California considers a passing grade on the CHSPE to be\nequivalent to a diploma.\n<None of the previous= includes those who have the recognized equivalent of a high school diploma other than a state-\nrecognized certificate or who may qualify under the Ability-to-Benefit (ATB) alternatives (see Volume 1, Chapter 1 of the\nFSA Handbook for additional information on ATB alternatives).\nIf the student selects <High School Diploma,= they must include the name, city and state (or FC for foreign country) where\nthe student received or will receive their diploma. On the FAFSA website, the student can use city and state to search for\ntheir high school. If they are unable to find their high school using the search functionality, they can manually enter the\nhigh school information. If the student selects <State-recognized high school equivalent,= they must indicate the\nequivalent type (GED, TASC, HiSET, or Other) and the issuing state. See Volume 1, Chapter 1 of the FSA Handbook,\nregarding a school9s policy about checking the validity of a high school diploma.\nFederal Benefits Received (18)\nA student may be eligible to have their assets excluded from the SAI calculation if they (or someone in their family)\nreceived one (or more) of the following federal benefits during the 2023 or 2024 calendar years.\nEarned income credit (EIC)\nFederal housing assistance\nFree or reduced-price school lunch*\nMedicaid\nRefundable credit for coverage under a qualified health plan (QHP)\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI)\nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)\n*Some individuals may receive free or reduced-price school lunch due to community eligibility rather than household\neligibility. Students should only indicate they received free or reduced-price school lunch on the FAFSA form if they meet\nthe income eligibility guidelines published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nStudent Tax Filing Status (19)\nThis three-part question asks the following:\n1. If the student did (or will) file a 2023 IRS 1040 or 1040-NR.\n2. Whether the student either (1) earned income in a foreign country in 2023, (2) worked for an international\norganization in 2023 and was not required to report income on any tax return, or (3) filed a 2023 tax return in Puerto\nRico or another U.S. territory.\n3. Finally, married students are asked if they filed their 2023 tax return with their current spouse.\nUnmarried students who answer <no= to the first two parts of the question are considered non-tax filers and, if\nindependent, do not need to answer any additional questions about income or assets. Married students who answer <no=\nto the first two parts of the question will still need to provide identity and contact information about their spouse.\nRecognized Equivalent of a High School Diploma\n34 CFR 600.2",

The IRS is more concerned whether a person is a resident or nonresident\nrather than a legal or illegal alien. An alien is anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or national. A resident alien is one who\neither is a permanent resident or has resided in the U.S. for a specific minimum amount of time (has met the substantial\npresence test). All others are nonresident aliens. Resident aliens9 income is generally subject to tax in the same manner\nas U.S. citizens9, and they file Form 1040. Nonresident aliens who are required to file a return submit Form 1040NR, which\nis acceptable documentation for verification.\nImmigrants who do not have an SSN and are unable to get one can apply with the IRS for an individual taxpayer\nidentification number (ITIN). The ITIN is only for tax purposes. It does not authorize a person to work, endorse his or her\nlegal status, or entitle them to the earned income credit or Social Security benefits.\nSee the IRS9s Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens at www.irs.gov for more information.\nInterim Disbursements\nInterim disbursements are allowed either prior to completing verification or after verification but before receiving the\ncorrected FAFSA Submission Summary or ISIR. If you have no reason to question the accuracy of the information on the\nFAFSA form, prior to completing verification you may at your discretion:\nMake one disbursement of Pell and FSEOG funds for the applicant9s first payment period;\nPermit FWS employment for the first 60 consecutive days after the student enrolls for the award year; or\nOriginate but not disburse a Direct Subsidized Loan.\nIf verification results in changes to the FAFSA information that you determine will not alter award amounts, you may at\nyour discretion also disburse a Direct Subsidized Loan prior to receiving the corrected valid FAFSA Submission Summary\nor ISIR (defined as a FAFSA Submission summary or ISIR on which all the information reported on a student9s FAFSA form\nis accurate and complete as of the date the application is signed).\nOverpayments From Interim Disbursements\nIf you make an interim disbursement of Pell or FSEOG funds prior to verification and the student9s eligibility for Title IV\nfunds changes after you complete verification, your school is liable for any resulting overpayment. If you can9t eliminate it\nby reducing subsequent disbursements or having the student return the money, your school must use its own funds to\nVerification for Confined or Incarcerated Individuals\n34 CFR Part 668 Subpart P\nDear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10\nInterim Disbursements\n34 CFR 668.58"

      "question": "How does the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) streamline the FAFSA application process by utilizing the Internal Revenue Service, and what role does the Internal Revenue Code play in this process?",
      "response": "The FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) streamlines the FAFSA application process by enabling the secure, near-real-time transfer of certain federal tax information (FTI) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) directly into the FAFSA form. This process reduces the need for applicants, such as students and their contributors (parents and spouses), to manually report their income and tax data, improving accuracy and saving time.\n\nHere's how it works:\n- When the applicant and contributors provide consent and approval, the IRS shares specific FTI—such as adjusted gross income, taxes paid, and other relevant tax data—with the Department of Education via the FA-DDX.\n- The data transferred from the IRS is considered verified, meaning it does not require additional manual verification unless discrepancies arise.\n- The FA-DDX replaces the previous IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT), which was opt-in only, making the process more automatic and accessible for all eligible applicants.\n\nThe role of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) in this process is foundational:\n- The FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the IRC, which governs the privacy and disclosure of federal tax information.\n- This amendment explicitly authorizes the IRS to disclose certain FTI to the Department of Education once the applicant and contributors have provided the necessary consent and approval.\n- Essentially, the IRC provides the legal authority and framework that allow the IRS to share tax information securely with the Department, enabling the FA-DDX to function within legal boundaries and protect taxpayer privacy.\n\nIn summary, the FA-DDX leverages the authority granted by the amended IRC to facilitate a more efficient, accurate, and secure transfer of tax data from the IRS to the FAFSA form, significantly streamlining the application process.",

        "Chapter 2\nFilling Out the FAFSA Form\nThis chapter describes the 2025-26 FAFSA form. While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3.\nThe easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\nprovided or imported. However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form.\nFUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\nan applicant9s FAFSA form.\nConsent and Approval\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\napplication method (online or paper).\nTo provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\nIRS;\nDefinitions\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department.\nFAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.",
        "Application and Verification Guide\nIntroduction\nThis guide is intended for college financial aid administrators and counselors who help students with the financial aid\nprocess4completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, verifying information, and making\ncorrections and other changes to the information reported on the FAFSA form.\nThroughout the Federal Student Aid Handbook, we use <college,= <school,= and <institution= interchangeably unless a\nmore specific use is given. Similarly, <student,= <applicant,= and <aid recipient= are synonyms. <Parents= in this volume\nrefers to the legal parents of dependent students, and <you= refers to the primary audience of the Handbook: financial aid\nadministrators at colleges. <We= indicates the U.S. Department of Education (the Department, ED), and <federal student\naid= and <Title IV aid= are synonymous terms for the financial aid offered by the Department.\nWe appreciate any comments that you have on the Application and Verification Guide (AVG), as well as all the volumes of\nthe FSA Handbook. We revise the text based on questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please\nreach out to us about how to improve the FSA Handbook through the <Contact Customer Support= feature in our Partner\nConnect Help Center clicking on <FSA Handbook= under the Topic section.\nFAFSA Simplification Act\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a\nsignificant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need\nanalysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the\nFAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for\nEducation (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process.\nChanges From the FUTURE Act\nThe Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data\nexchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate\ncompleting the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data\nRetrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX\neliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information\nreported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered\nverified for Title IV purposes.\nUnlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s\nspouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via\nthe FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid.\nOther Changes\nThroughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references\nhave been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year.\nWhere appropriate, links and publications associated with FSA9s Partner Connect and Knowledge Center have been\nproperly updated. We also removed references to COVID-19 guidance and waivers.\nSome sections were moved to better align topics and assist with narrative flow. Use the search feature to find sections\nthat may have been relocated. The following describes changes made in each chapter.\nChapter 1: The Application Process\nWe removed the <Returning FAFSA Filers= section as FAFSA renewal functionality has been deferred for future cycles.",
        "2. The disclosure of their FTI by the IRS to the Department;\n3. The use of their FTI by a Department official to determine an applicant9s eligibility for federal student aid and the\namount for which they are eligible; and\n4. The redisclosure of FTI by the Department to an eligible institution, state higher education agency, or a designated\nscholarship organization (e.g., institutional or state financial aid).\nOnly the Department has the authority to obtain approval and consent for the use and disclosure of FTI for such purposes.\nOur partners (FAAs, advocates, etc.) are not permitted to obtain approval and consent on behalf of FAFSA contributors\n(including parent(s) or spouse) for the use and disclosure of FTI.\nOnce a FAFSA contributor has provided consent and approval for use and disclosure of FTI for a FAFSA cycle (e.g., the\n2025-26 FAFSA cycle), they cannot revoke consent for that cycle. The ability to revoke consent is not needed for FAFSA\npurposes because the FAFSA contributor is providing a one-time consent for a specific tax year and an annual consent is\nrequired for each FAFSA cycle.\nStudents and contributors are not able to view or edit the imported FTI data. This is to enhance security, privacy, and to\nreduce the risk of the misuse of sensitive data. However, you (the financial aid administrator) will be able to see the\ntransferred data on the ISIR. Schools and other partners that receive ISIRs must protect federal student aid information\nprovided to them by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the application, award, and administration of the\nfederal student aid programs as permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA, as amended. In keeping with the\nexpectation that you protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, you must not disclose FTI\nfrom the FAFSA form unless the disclosure and use is permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA 1098h. For additional\ninformation and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34.\nSignatures\nEach student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS\nand (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per\napplication cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a\nprocessed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is\naccurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction\nto contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating\nthat the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their\nFAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect\nthe necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature\nrequirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval. Only the Department can collect a contributor9s\nconsent and approval.\nFederal Tax Information\nThe following data received by the Department from the IRS are considered FTI:\nTax Year (ex. Award year 2025-26 is based on 2023 tax year information from the IRS)\nTax Filing Status\nAdjusted Gross Income (AGI)\nNumber of Exemptions and Number of Dependents\nIncome Earned from Work\nTaxes Paid\nEducational Credits\nUntaxed IRA distributions\nIRA deductions and payments\nTax exempt interest\nUntaxed pension amounts\nSchedule C net profit/loss",
        "Indicators for Schedules A, B, D, E, F, H\nIRS response code\nIn some limited circumstances, the student or contributor may need to manually provide data if it is unavailable through\nthe FA-DDX or does not reflect their current personal circumstances. In these cases, manually entered data will be used in\nthe SAI calculation. For example, a contributor would be required to manually report income and tax data if they were\nmarried and filed their 2023 U.S. tax return jointly with their spouse but are now divorced.\nIRS Response Codes\nThe IRS will provide one of the following response codes for each contributor, and they will appear on a student9s ISIR.\nCode\nIndication\n200\nUsable FTI data retrieved successfully\n214\nNo return on file\n203\n206\n212\nNo usable FTI data retrieved\nThe IRS provides a response code value of <200= when the IRS has data and it was successfully shared with FSA for\ninclusion on the applicant9s FAFSA form. Income and tax information for contributors with a <200= IRS response code is\nconsidered verified. The IRS response code of <214= means the IRS was able to locate the individual in its records and\nconfirmed that it does not have a tax return on file for that individual for the tax year, designating them as a non-U.S. tax\nfiler.\nIRS response codes <203=, <206=, and <212= indicate that the IRS is unable to provide FTI for that contributor. This may be\nbecause the IRS is unable to locate the individual in its records or the IRS is unable to share FTI (such as in cases of\nidentity theft). If the IRS returns any of these codes for a contributor, that individual must manually provide income and\ntax information on the applicant9s FAFSA form. This manually entered data will be used in the SAI calculation but is not\nconsidered verified and may be subject to verification if selected by the Department or your institution.\nContributors\n<Contributor= refers to anyone who is required to provide information, consent, and approval, and a signature on the\nFAFSA form. The FAFSA form is organized by contributor. Each contributor will complete their own section of the form\nwhich contains specific questions and instructions pertaining to that contributor. The guidance in this chapter\nsupplements those instructions and explains why some of the questions are needed on the FAFSA form.\nThe following sections discuss the questions found within each contributor section on the FAFSA form. The parents\nmentioned are the legal parents of dependent students. The numbers in parentheses are for the items as they appear on\nthe FAFSA Submission Summary, ISIR, paper (PDF) FAFSA, and FAFSA Partner Portal. The FAFSA form is considered a\n<snapshot= of the family9s information as of the date the application is signed and it can be updated only in certain\ncircumstances and only for certain items. See Chapter 4 for more information about updating a FAFSA form.\nContributor: Student\nThis section consists of 24 questions related to the student.\nStudent Identity Information (1)\nThis question requests the name, date of birth, and Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification\nNumber (ITIN) of the student contributor. The name, with other identifying information, is used for several data matches.",
        "must not put the seal of the Department of Education on any verification documents.\nThe one exception is that schools must use the exact language provided in the <Statement of Educational Purpose= for\nstudents who are placed in verification tracking groups V4 or V5. This does not include the accompanying notary9s\ncertificate of acknowledgment; for that the school may use some other form, such as the one its state uses.\nIncome Information for Tax Filers\nAs already noted, the importation of IRS tax data (FTI) via the FA-DDX serves as verification documentation. Applicants\nand contributors will not see or be given the option to change FTI imported directly from the IRS via the FA-DDX. Data\ntransferred in this manner is considered verified, but there may be other data elements that must still be verified with\nadditional documentation.\nFAFSA\nInformation\nAcceptable Documentation\n(a) Adjusted\nGross\nIncome\n(AGI)\n(b) Income\nEarned from\nWork\n(c) U.S.\nIncome Tax\nPaid\n(d) Untaxed\nPortions of\nIRA\nDistributions\n(e) Untaxed\nPortions of\nPensions\n(f) IRA\nDeductions\nand\nPayments\n(g) Tax\nExempt\nInterest\nIncome\n(h)\nEducation\nCredits\n(i) Foreign\nIncome\nExempt\nfrom Federal\nTaxation\nItems (a) through (h), if transferred directly from the IRS and unchanged, do not need to be verified.\nWhen information is not transferred from the IRS, and for item (i), the following documentation is\nsufficient for verification:\n(1) A transcript obtained at no cost from the IRS or other relevant tax authority of a U.S. territory\n(Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands) or commonwealth (Puerto Rico and the Northern\nMariana Islands), or a foreign government, that lists 2023 tax account information of the tax filer; or\n(2) A signed copy of the income tax return)and the applicable schedules that were filed with the IRS\nor other relevant tax authority of a U.S. territory, or a foreign government that lists 2023 tax account\ninformation of the tax filer.\n(3) If item (d) or (e) contains a rollover, a signed statement confirming the amount of the rollover in\nthe untaxed pension or IRA distribution. Note that even if (d) or (e) are transferred as FTI, rollovers\nstill need to be verified as they are manually entered.\nQualified rollovers from one retirement account to another are not taxable, and they should not be counted as untaxed\nincome (Untaxed portions of IRA distributions (d) or Pensions (e) above). Since neither a tax transcript nor FTI transferred\nvia the FA-DDX identifies rollovers, you must get documentation from the tax filer. This could be a signed statement with\nthe rollover amount or a notation by the filer on the tax transcript or return that includes the word <rollover= beside any",
        "Chapter 1\nThe Application Process: FAFSA to ISIR\nThe laws governing the Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs require that a person apply for aid with a form provided by\nthe U.S. Department of Education (ED, Department) and that no fee be charged for processing it. This form is the Free\nApplication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form.\nTo be considered for federal student aid, a student must complete a FAFSA form. It collects financial and other information\nused to calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI; formerly Expected Family Contribution or EFC) and to determine a student9s\neligibility through computer matches with other agencies.\nThe FAFSA form is the only application students must complete to apply for Title IV aid. A school cannot require extra\ninformation from students to package Title IV aid, except for verification, resolution of conflicting information, or\nprofessional judgment determinations. However, a school may require additional information for other purposes, such as\npackaging private or institutional aid. If the school collects additional information that affects Title IV eligibility, it must\ntake the information into account when awarding Title IV aid.\nTypes of FAFSA Applications\nMore than 99% of FAFSA forms are filed electronically. However, there are other options for individuals unwilling or unable\nto file electronically.\nFAFSA Online\nImplementation of the FAFSA Simplification Act and the FUTURE Act required a complete overhaul of the FAFSA form,\nbeginning with the 2024-25 award year. Submitted FAFSA forms are sent directly to the FAFSA Processing System (FPS).\nHelp is available for students online or by calling the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-4-FED-AID\n(1-800-433-3243).\nThere are many advantages to filing electronically, including:\nFaster processing;\nAvailability of online help;\nSkip logic, which allows applicants to skip over questions that don9t pertain to them; and\nFewer errors and rejected applications because internal and end-of-entry data edits ensure that required fields are\ncompleted and conflicts are resolved prior to submission.\nPaper (PDF) FAFSA Form\nThe paper (PDF) FAFSA form is available on StudentAid.gov. In future cycles, students will also be able to call the Federal\nStudent Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-433-3243 to request a single copy.\nThe form can be printed and completed by hand, or by typing the data on the PDF before printing and mailing it. The\nmailing address is printed on the first page of the FAFSA form under <Mail Your FAFSA® Form=. The address changes\nannually, so use the address printed on the associated year9s FAFSA form.\nYou must mail all fillable pages of the form (pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to\nthe applicant. Extra postage will be required due to the size and/or weight of the mailing.\nFSA no longer prints or mails aid-related publications, though they are available on StudentAid.gov for users to download\nand print.\nIncarcerated Applicants\nIncarcerated applicants who have access to the necessary technology can complete a FAFSA form online using their\nStudentAid.gov account username and password. However, many incarcerated applicants will not be able to file",
        "electronically due to limitations on access to computers and the internet. These applicants can complete a paper (PDF)\nFAFSA form designated specifically for incarcerated applicants, available on the Prison Education Programs resource page\nof the FSA Knowledge Center.\nThe mailing address for the Incarcerated Applicant FAFSA form is printed on the first page of the form under <Mail Your\nFAFSA® Form=. The address changes annually and differs from the general FAFSA form mailing address, so use the\naddress printed on the associated year9s Incarcerated Applicant FAFSA form. You must mail all fillable pages of the form\n(pages 7-20), including pages that are left blank because they do not apply to the applicant. Extra postage will be\nrequired due to the size and/or weight of the mailing.\nFAFSA Partner Portal\nThe FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP) replaced FAA Access to CPS Online beginning with the 2024-25 award year. FSA\ndecommissioned the FAA Access site after the 2023324 application cycle closed.\nThe FAFSA Partner Portal removed the ability for a financial aid administrator (FAA) to initiate a new application on behalf\nof a student. This is due to the requirement in the FUTURE Act that all FAFSA form contributors (including students,\nspouses, and parents) must provide their consent to disclose information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\napproval to retrieve and use certain Federal Tax Information (FTI). FAAs cannot provide consent and approval on behalf of\nany other person. Therefore, you will not be able to use the FPP to start and submit a new FAFSA form on an applicant9s\nbehalf. However, you can make certain corrections or updates.\nTranslation Assistance\nThe FAFSA form is available in English and Spanish. If you need assistance completing the form in English or Spanish\ncontact the FSAIC at 1-800-433-3243. Translation assistance in additional languages is available by calling 1-833-610-\n2590 and pressing <7= to request a specific language.\nAccount Username and Password (FSA ID)\nThe account username and password, also known as the FSA ID, is used to access a person9s StudentAid.gov account. It\nserves as an electronic signature and a digital identifier to allow access to various ED systems and services for students,\nspouses of students, parents, or spouses/partners of parents. Therefore, each individual must create their own account\nand should not share their login credentials with anyone, including FAAs. Users can create an account online at\nStudentAid.gov quickly and securely. See Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-123 for additional information on\ncreating a StudentAid.gov account for individuals without a Social Security number.\nEach person who provides data in the online FAFSA form must have an account username and password to access the\nform. In the past, a Social Security number (SSN) was required to create a StudentAid.gov account. Starting with the\n2024325 award year, all individuals4even those without an SSN4can create a StudentAid.gov account. Persons with an\nSSN will still have their information verified by the Social Security Administration (SSA), while those without an SSN will\nuse the TransUnion® knowledge-based identity verification process described below.\nThe account username and password are created in real-time so that the student or other contributor can use it\nimmediately to enter the FAFSA form. Pending StudentAid.gov accounts with an SSN will be sent to the SSA to be\nmatched. Only those accounts with a successful match (<SSA Match Status= value of 4 on the Institutional Student\nNote: There will be two active portals that coincide with the two open FAFSA application cycles.

        "Students or parents who file an amended return (IRS Form 1040X) and provide consent and approval to retrieve FTI via\nthe FA-DDX will not have their amended information transferred to the FAFSA form. The IRS will transfer only original tax\ninformation to the FAFSA form via the FA-DDX. However, there is currently no indicator on the FAFSA form that the tax\nreturn was amended and the original data may be inaccurate. If you are aware that an applicant or contributor filed an\namended return, you must update or correct the applicant9s FAFSA form. You must also check the PJ flag on the corrected\nISIR transaction so that FPS recalculates the student9s SAI and Pell Grant eligibility using the manually entered tax\ninformation (instead of the FTI received via the FA-DDX).\nIf the applicant is selected for verification and you are aware that the applicant or a contributor has filed an amended\nreturn, you must use the amended return information to complete verification. However, if you were not previously aware\nthat an applicant or contributor filed an amended return, you are not required to confirm whether an amended return was\nfiled as part of the verification process. You may still consider the FTI transferred from the IRS to be verified if you have no\nreason to believe the applicant or a contributor filed an amended return.\nApplicants or contributors may submit a signed copy of the filed 1040X form and one of the following documents to\ncomplete verification:\nIncome and tax information from the IRS on an ISIR record with all tax information from the original tax return;\nA transcript obtained from the IRS that lists 2023 tax account information of the tax filer(s); or\nA signed copy of the 2023 IRS Form 1040 and the applicable schedules that were filed with the IRS.\nBecause the tax return transcript does not reflect changes to the original return by the filer or the IRS, it is, by itself, not\nsufficient.\nWhen an amended return was filed, you must submit any changes to nondollar items and to single monetary items of $25\nor more.\nNote that there may be instances when a student, spouse, or parent did not file a 1040X with the IRS but had their tax\nand income information amended by the IRS. In such a case a school may accept one of the items mentioned above plus\ndocumentation showing the IRS9s change(s).\nVictims of Tax-Related Identity Theft\nIndividuals who are victims of tax-related identity theft cannot get a return transcript or have their FTI transferred via the\nFA-DDX.\nIn the past we have requested individuals who are victims of IRS tax-related identity theft to obtain a Tax Return\nDataBase View (TRDBV) transcript from the IRS for verification purposes. However, the Department is aware that TRDBV\ntranscript requests have been taking over a year to process. Due to the long processing time, we will instead require\nindividuals who are victims of IRS tax-related identity theft to provide a copy of the following:\nA signed copy of the 2023 income tax return and applicable schedules the individual filed with the IRS; and\nAn IRS 4674C letter (a letter from the IRS acknowledging the identity theft) or a statement signed and dated by the\ntax filer indicating that he or she was a victim of IRS tax-related identity theft, and the IRS is aware of it.\nThis change to required documentation was provided in Dear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10.\nVerification for Confined or Incarcerated Individuals\nConfined or incarcerated individuals enrolled in approved prison education programs (PEPs) are eligible for Federal Pell\nGrants.\nFor the 2025-26 award year, a confined or incarcerated individual as indicated through the incarcerated applicant flag will\nonly be required to verify their identity and statement of educational purpose if selected for Verification Tracking Group\nV4 or V5. In addition, institutions are not required to verify a confined or incarcerated individual selected under\nVerification Tracking Flag V1.\nIf a confined or incarcerated student is unable to submit a signed and notarized statement of educational purpose, a\nschool may accept a signed statement from an authorized official who works for the correctional facility or the oversight",

A pending username and password that has not been verified will still\nallow the user to access and submit the online FAFSA form and complete other limited actions on StudentAid.gov.\nHowever, the Department will not be able to retrieve federal tax data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For this\nreason, we recommend that users do not sign and submit the online FAFSA form until the account username and\npassword is verified through a match with the SSA.\nIf the SSN match is unsuccessful, the account is not considered verified, and an email is sent to notify the individual that\nthey should review the information they provided (name, date of birth, and SSN) to ensure it is accurate. If the applicant\nused an unverified account username and password to sign their FAFSA form, the applicant is also sent a paper FAFSA\nSubmission Summary requesting all required signatures.\nTransUnion® Knowledge-Based Identity Verification\nUsers who create a StudentAid.gov account without an SSN will be required to complete a knowledge-based identity\nverification process with TransUnion® to verify their identity and provide login credentials. The student (if a citizen of one\nof the Freely Associated States - the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, or the Federated States of\nMicronesia), student9s spouse, parent, or parent spouse/partner are sent through the TransUnion® process when they do\nnot have an SSN and check the <I don9t have an SSN= box during the account creation process. They will be asked to\nprovide additional information to confirm their identity.\nFAFSA Filers Under the Age of 13\nBecause the Children9s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 prohibits any entity, including a government\nagency, from electronically conducting business or communicating with a person under age 13, applicants who are 12 or\nyounger cannot complete the FAFSA form online. Instead, when they apply for financial aid, the student and required\ncontributor(s) can fill out the appropriate award year paper (PDF) FAFSA form and mail it to:\nFederal Student Aid Programs\nAttn: COPPA Process\n25 Air Park Drive\nLondon, KY 40744-8236\nSuch applicants should not provide an email address on the application or any correction that might follow. After the\nFAFSA form is submitted, it will be processed and a paper FAFSA Submission Summary will be sent to the student and an\nISIR will be sent to schools.

The parent will see an abbreviated confirmation, letting them know that the form is\ncomplete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide an email address will receive email notification\nwhen their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who do not provide\nan email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nContributor: Parent Spouse or Partner\nThis section consists of five questions related to the spouse or partner of a parent of a dependent student. If the student9s\nparent is married, the spouse9s information is always required on the FAFSA form. If the student9s parent is unmarried and\nliving with a partner, the partner9s information is only required on the FAFSA form if the partner is also the student9s legal\nparent.\nThe parent spouse or partner is only a required contributor on the FAFSA form if the parent is either (1) married or\nremarried and did not file taxes jointly with their current spouse in 2023, or (2) unmarried and living with the student9s\nother legal parent. If the parent contributor is completing the FAFSA form online and the parent9s spouse is identified as a\nrequired contributor, the parent will be prompted to enter the parent spouse9s or partner9s identity information (name,\nSocial Security number, date of birth, and email address) to invite them to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The\nparent spouse or partner will be notified by email that they have been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form.\nThe spouse or partner should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and password to access the student9s\nFAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the parent9s spouse is not a required contributor, the parent will\nenter the same identifying information and email address, but the parent9s spouse will not be invited to contribute to the\nstudent9s FAFSA form.\nIf the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent9s spouse or partner complete the",
        "reconcile the conflicting information and take appropriate action under the specific program requirements (depending on\nthe outcome, funds may have to be returned).\nSubsequent ISIRs\nYou are generally required to review all subsequent transactions for a student for the entire processing year even if you\nverified an earlier transaction. An exception to this requirement is if a later transaction comes in after the student is no\nlonger enrolled at your institution. Review the SAI, C flag, or verification tracking group for changes. Review new\ncomments or NSLDS information that impacts eligibility for aid. Check any updates or corrections. If the SAI has not\nchanged and there are no changes in the C flag, verification tracking group, or NSLDS information, no action is generally\nrequired. If the SAI does change but it either doesn9t affect the amount and type of aid received or the data elements that\nchanged were already verified, no action is required. But if the SAI changes and the pertinent data elements were not\nverified, then you must investigate. Of course, any time the C flag changes or NSLDS data have been modified, you must\nresolve any conflicts.\nDiscrepant Tax Data\nFinancial aid administrators do not need to be tax experts, but there are some issues that even a layperson with basic tax\nlaw information can evaluate. Because conflicting data often involve such information, FAAs must have a fundamental\nunderstanding of relevant tax issues that can impact the need analysis. You are obligated to know (1) whether a person\nwas required to file a tax return and (2) what the correct filing status for a person should be. The IRS9s online Interactive\nTax Assistant can help with these and other issues by walking the user through a series of questions. IRS Publication 17 is\nalso a useful resource.\nResolution of Conflicting Information\nYou must resolve conflicting information prior to disbursing aid to a student enrolled at your school. Even if the conflict\nconcerns a previous award year, you must still investigate it. You have resolved the matter when you have\ndetermined which data are correct; this might simply be confirming that an earlier determination was the right one. You\nmust document your findings and include an explanation that justifies your decision.\nThe verification page on the FSA Assessments site has guidance to help you review your conflicting information\nprocedures; see Activity 1.\nReferral of Fraud Cases\nRequirement to Verify Questionable Data\n34 CFR 668.54(a)(2)\nDiscrepant Tax Data Example\nAVG, Chapter 5, Example 7: An FAA notices that a dependent student9s parents, who are married and live\ntogether, have each filed as head of household (which offers a greater tax deduction than filing as single or\nmarried). The FAA must ask if that is the right status. Resolution of the conflict could be the parents refiling and\nsubmitting a copy of the amended return or a reasonable explanation of why there is no conflict under IRS rules.",
        "Received (18)= question for a list of these federal benefits.\nParent Tax Filing Status (37)\nThis question asks if the parent filed (or will file) a 2023 IRS 1040 or 1040-NR. If the answer is <no=, the parent will be\nasked to select one of the following reasons for not filing:\n1. The parent filed or will file a tax return with Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory.\n2. The parent filed or will file a foreign tax return.\n3. The parent either earned income in a foreign country but did not and will not file a foreign tax return, or worked for\nan international organization and was not required to report income on any tax return.\n4. The parent, even though they earned income in the U.S., did not and will not file a U.S. tax return because their\nincome was below the filing threshold.\n5. The parent did not and will not file a U.S. tax return for reasons other than low income.\n6. The parent did not and will not file any tax return because they did not earn any income or they were not required to\nfile under the Internal Revenue Code.\nThe purpose of these questions is to determine if a parent was either (1) required to file a 2023 U.S. federal tax return and\ndid not or (2) has income from a foreign country that must be manually entered on the FAFSA form.\nA dependent student will be automatically eligible for a Maximum Pell Grant if their parent (and parent9s spouse or\npartner) is subject to the U.S. Tax Code but is not required to file a 2023 U.S. federal tax return. The student will be\nassigned an SAI of -1,500 and will not be required to provide any further financial information on the FAFSA form.\nFinally, married parents are asked if they filed their 2023 tax return with their current spouse. Individuals who were\nmarried and filed jointly with the IRS and are no longer married to the spouse on the applicable tax return, or who have\nmarried a different spouse, will be required to manually enter their income and tax information. See the <Joint Return\nFilers Who Are No Longer Married= section in Chapter 4 for additional information on separating tax return and income\ninformation.\nIndividuals who only file foreign tax returns will also be unable to use the FA-DDX since it does not link to foreign tax\nauthorities. They will instead need to manually input their income and tax data by converting foreign currency to U.S.\ndollars and entering the resulting amounts in the comparable fields from U.S. tax returns. See the <Student Tax Filing\nStatus (19)= question for additional information.\nIf the parent indicates they earned income in a foreign country but did not file a foreign tax return, or worked for an\ninternational organization, such as the United Nations, World Bank, or International Monetary Fund (option 3), they will\nneed to manually input their income and tax data, similar to individuals who file foreign tax returns. See <Non-tax filers,\nforeign countries, and international organizations= under <Student Tax Filing Status (19)= for additional guidance.\nIf a parent indicates they did not file a U.S. tax return for reasons other than low income (option 5), you should treat this\nas conflicting information and request documentation to resolve it, which may include requiring the individual to file a tax\nreturn and present sufficient documentation of filing to you.\nIf a parent indicates they did not file any tax return because they did not earn any income (option 6) and their state of\nlegal residence is a foreign country, you must determine if the parent has foreign untaxed income that, when included in\nthe SAI calculation, impacts a student9s Pell Grant eligibility. Comment code 303 on the student9s ISIR should prompt you\nto request additional documentation. If your inquiry into the parents9 financial situation shows that the student might be\neligible for less or no Pell grant funds, you may use PJ to account for the parents9 untaxed income and assets, similar to\nthe action you might take when there is a substantial foreign earned income exclusion on a U.S. tax return that can affect\na student9s Pell eligibility.\nParent 2023 Tax Return Information (38)\nFor U.S. tax filers, much of the information in Question 38 will be transferred directly from the IRS via the FA-DDX.",
        "parent spouse or partner contributor section.\nParent Spouse or Partner Identity Information (42)\nLike the student, the parent spouse or partner identity information should match what appears on their social security\ncard. If the parent spouse or partner does not have a Social Security number and is completing their section of the form\nonline, the SSN field will automatically be blank based on the information in their StudentAid.gov account. If the parent\nspouse is completing their section using the paper (PDF) FAFSA, they should enter all zeros in the SSN field. In both\napplication methods, the parent should enter their ITIN, if they have one, in the ITIN field.\nParent Spouse or Partner Contact Information (43)\nThis is the parent spouse9s or partner9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address.\nParent Spouse or Partner Tax Filing Status (44)\nThis question asks if the parent spouse or partner filed (or will file) a 2023 IRS 1040 or 1040-NR. It also asks about income\nearned in a foreign country or if the parent spouse or partner filed a tax return in a U.S. territory. See the discussion of tax\nreturn data in the <Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the\nFA-DDX or be manually entered by the parent spouse or partner.\nParent Spouse or Partner 2023 Tax Return Information (45)\nThis information comes directly from the parent spouse9s or partner9s 2023 federal tax return. See the discussion of tax\nreturn data in the <Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the\nFA-DDX or be manually entered by the parent spouse or partner. Unlike the parent, the parent spouse or partner will not\nbe asked to report either (1) taxable college grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits, or (2) receipt of the earned\nincome credit. See <Student Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28)= for further explanation of these two excluded\nelements.\nParent Spouse or Partner Consent, Approval, and Signature (46)\nEvery parent spouse or partner contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid:\nConsent 3 The parent spouse or partner contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information\nto the IRS.\nApproval 3 The parent spouse or partner must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may\nreceive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI).\nSignature 3 The parent spouse or partner contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their\nsignature on the online FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form.\nFAFSA Submission\nA dependent student with (1) unmarried parents living together or (2) a married or remarried parent who did not file their\n2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete FAFSA form ready for processing. The student will\nreceive an email confirmation that their FAFSA form is complete. The parent spouse or partner will see an abbreviated\nconfirmation that the form is complete, and that the student has been notified. If the applicant provided an email address,\nthey will receive an email when the FAFSA form is processed with instructions for accessing their FAFSA Submission\nSummary. Applicants without an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary.\nRole: Preparer\nIf someone other than the student, student spouse, parent, or parent spouse or partner completed a portion of the FAFSA\nform on the applicant9s behalf, that person must complete the Preparer section. Paid preparers are prohibited. This\nsection consists of three questions related to the unpaid preparer."
