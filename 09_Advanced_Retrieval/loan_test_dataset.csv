"What changes did the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 bring to the FAFSA process?","['Application and Verification Guide Introduction This guide is intended for college financial aid administrators and counselors who help students with the financial aid process4completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, verifying information, and making corrections and other changes to the information reported on the FAFSA form. Throughout the Federal Student Aid Handbook, we use <college,= <school,= and <institution= interchangeably unless a more specific use is given. Similarly, <student,= <applicant,= and <aid recipient= are synonyms. <Parents= in this volume refers to the legal parents of dependent students, and <you= refers to the primary audience of the Handbook: financial aid administrators at colleges. <We= indicates the U.S. Department of Education (the Department, ED), and <federal student aid= and <Title IV aid= are synonymous terms for the financial aid offered by the Department. We appreciate any comments that you have on the Application and Verification Guide (AVG), as well as all the volumes of the FSA Handbook. We revise the text based on questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please reach out to us about how to improve the FSA Handbook through the <Contact Customer Support= feature in our Partner Connect Help Center clicking on <FSA Handbook= under the Topic section. FAFSA Simplification Act The FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a significant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need analysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the FAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process. Changes From the FUTURE Act The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data exchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate completing the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX eliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information reported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered verified for Title IV purposes. Unlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s spouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via the FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid. Other Changes Throughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references have been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year. Where appropriate, links and publications associated with FSA9s Partner Connect and Knowledge Center have been properly updated. We also removed references to COVID-19 guidance and waivers. Some sections were moved to better align topics and assist with narrative flow. Use the search feature to find sections that may have been relocated. The following describes changes made in each chapter.']","The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which included the FAFSA Simplification Act, mandated a significant overhaul of federal student aid, including changes to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form, need analysis, and many policies and procedures for schools participating in Title IV programs.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
Wht is the purpose of the FAFSA Submission Summary in the financial aid process?,"['The FPS also checks the application for possible inconsistencies and mistakes. For instance, if a dependent student reported the parents9 marital status as married but reported the family size as <2,= the edit checks would catch the inconsistency. Even when data is inconsistent, the FPS may be able to calculate an SAI based on assumptions. Students who submit applications online will be able to correct or confirm FPS edits before submitting the application. Output Documents After processing is complete, the FPS produces output documents 3 the Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) and the FAFSA Submission Summary 3 that show the information the student originally provided, the SAI, results of the eligibility matches, information about aid history, and information about any inconsistencies identified through the FPS edits. If the FPS was unable to calculate an SAI, the output record will not show one. The ISIR is made available electronically to the schools the student listed on the FAFSA form (or added later) and their state agency. The FAFSA Submission Summary is made available to the student online or a paper FAFSA Submission Summary is mailed to the student if the student is unable to access it online. The type of output document depends on the type of record that the applicant submitted. Neither the online nor the paper FAFSA Submission Summary will contain FTI. See Volume 6 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide for additional information. You will receive an ISIR for the student only if the applicant includes your school on their FAFSA form. If your school is not listed, you can request an ISIR for the student through the FAFSA Partner Portal by adding your federal school code if you have the applicant9s Data Release Number (DRN), which authorizes your access to the student9s application information. The DRN appears on the FAFSA Submission Summary, on the FAFSA confirmation page, and in the FAFSA confirmation email. You are required to receive ISIRs and to accept FAFSA Submission Summaries from students, but you cannot require students to submit FAFSA Submission Summaries to receive aid. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student, your federal school code must be added to their record so that an ISIR is sent to you. We recommend making corrections electronically via the online FAFSA (the student) or the FAFSA Partner Portal (the school); however, students can also use a paper FAFSA Submission Summary to make corrections. If you don9t have an ISIR for a student who provided a FAFSA Submission Summary, you must use the FAFSA Submission Summary to package and disburse the student aid. Again, you must also ensure that your school code is added to the student9s FPS record (see the <How to Submit Corrections and Updates= section in Chapter 4). The FAFSA Submission Summaries and ISIRs include comment codes and text explaining any questionable results from FAFSA processing. Some comment codes also have an associated C Flag, which you must resolve before paying the student aid. If a student9s FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR contains a comment code that requires resolution, the underlying issue must be resolved before any Title IV funds may be disbursed to the student. For instance, if an applicant has defaulted on a federal student loan, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will note this in several places, including comments to the applicant and the NSLDS financial aid history page. In addition, if a school disburses Title IV funds to a student with a comment code that requires resolution and the student withdraws before the school has resolved the underlying issue, any funds disbursed must be returned to ED since the funds were provided to an otherwise ineligible student. For other problems, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will show that the FAFSA form has been rejected and no SAI has been calculated. The FAFSA Submission Summary will tell the applicant how to resolve the reject by correcting errors or providing consent and approval, signatures, or more information. A complete list of comments, C Flags, reject codes, and required resolutions are available in Volume 7 of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide. A valid output document (ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary) is one on which all the information reported on a student9s FAFSA form is accurate and complete as of the date the application is signed.']","The FAFSA Submission Summary shows the information the student originally provided, the SAI, results of the eligibility matches, information about aid history, and information about any inconsistencies identified through the FPS edits. It is made available to the student online or mailed as a paper document if the student cannot access it online. It helps students and schools ensure that all information is accurate and complete for financial aid processing.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
What information can financial aid administrators view on the ISIR?,"['2. The disclosure of their FTI by the IRS to the Department; 3. The use of their FTI by a Department official to determine an applicant9s eligibility for federal student aid and the amount for which they are eligible; and 4. The redisclosure of FTI by the Department to an eligible institution, state higher education agency, or a designated scholarship organization (e.g., institutional or state financial aid). Only the Department has the authority to obtain approval and consent for the use and disclosure of FTI for such purposes. Our partners (FAAs, advocates, etc.) are not permitted to obtain approval and consent on behalf of FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) for the use and disclosure of FTI. Once a FAFSA contributor has provided consent and approval for use and disclosure of FTI for a FAFSA cycle (e.g., the 2025-26 FAFSA cycle), they cannot revoke consent for that cycle. The ability to revoke consent is not needed for FAFSA purposes because the FAFSA contributor is providing a one-time consent for a specific tax year and an annual consent is required for each FAFSA cycle. Students and contributors are not able to view or edit the imported FTI data. This is to enhance security, privacy, and to reduce the risk of the misuse of sensitive data. However, you (the financial aid administrator) will be able to see the transferred data on the ISIR. Schools and other partners that receive ISIRs must protect federal student aid information provided to them by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the application, award, and administration of the federal student aid programs as permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA, as amended. In keeping with the expectation that you protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, you must not disclose FTI from the FAFSA form unless the disclosure and use is permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA 1098h. For additional information and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34. Signatures Each student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS and (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per application cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a processed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is accurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction to contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating that the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their FAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect the necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature requirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval. Only the Department can collect a contributor9s consent and approval.']",Financial aid administrators can view the transferred data on the ISIR.,single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
What FTI mean and what info it include?,['Federal Tax Information The following data received by the Department from the IRS are considered FTI: Tax Year (ex.

Wut shud a student do if they need to contact the FSAIC to sync their data with the SSA?,"['Because the Department matches the student9s name and SSN with the Social Security Administration (SSA), the name on the FAFSA form should match the one in the SSA9s records (i.e., as it appears on the student9s Social Security card). Students (except citizens of one of the Freely Associated States 3 see <Account Username and Password= in Chapter 1) must have an SSN to apply for federal student aid. If they submit a paper (PDF) FAFSA form without an SSN, the FAFSA form will be returned unprocessed. Students will be unable to submit a FAFSA form electronically without an account username and password, which requires an SSN (except students who are citizens one of the Freely Associated States). The student must contact the local SSA office to get an SSN or to find out what the number is if they lost their Social Security card. Go to https://www.ssa.gov/number-card for more information. If the student9s name, date of birth, or SSN does not match with the Social Security Administration, the student typically needs to resolve the issue with the SSA. If the information submitted is correct, the student must contact SSA to update its records. After the student receives confirmation that SSA has corrected its records, the student must contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) and ask them to manually sync their data with SSA. Alternatively, if the student notifies the school that they received confirmation from SSA, the FAA may update the Resend to Matches field to <Y= in the FAFSA Partner Portal and submit it as a correction so the transaction can go back to SSA for an updated match flag. Records sent for rematching will continue to receive this match flag until SSA updates its database. Students who enter their name, date of birth, or SSN incorrectly should log in to StudentAid.gov and update their information in Account Settings. The record will be resent to SSA for matching. Once SSA verifies the account, the student should update their FAFSA form by submitting a correction. Student Contact Information (2) This is the student9s current mobile phone, email address, and permanent home address, with three exceptions: Students under the age of 13 should not provide an email address as FSA cannot communicate with them electronically. See <FAFSA Filers Under the Age of 13= in Chapter 1 for additional information. Incarcerated students should use an address where they can reliably receive mail. This may be the physical address of the facility they are in, the address of the school (if permitted by the school), or a central processing facility used by the facility for mail distribution. If a prison ID number is required by the facility for the applicant to receive mail, the applicant should list that at the end of the address field. If an incarcerated student is released, they should also update their address in their StudentAid.gov account or on their FAFSA Submission Summary. Homeless students should use a mailing address where they can reliably receive mail. That can be the address of a relative or friend who has given them permission to use it, or it can be their school9s address if they have contacted the school for permission and instructions on how mail they receive at the school will reach them. As soon as homeless students have more permanent housing, they should update their address in their StudentAid.gov account or on their FAFSA Submission Summary. If the student provides an email address, they should get an email with a link to their online FAFSA Submission Summary within one to three days after the FPS receives the completed application. The Department will also use this email address to correspond with the student regarding their application.']","After the student receives confirmation that SSA has corrected its records, the student must contact the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) and ask them to manually sync their data with SSA.",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
How is the definition of a parent on the FAFSA relevant to the completion of the form for students with unmarried biological parents living together?,"['<1-hop>\n\nThis question asks if a 2023 IRS Form 1040 or 1040-NR was (or will be) completed. It also asks about income earned in a foreign country or if the student spouse filed a tax return in a U.S. territory. See the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)= question for additional information. Student Spouse 2023 Tax Return Information (28) This information comes directly from the student spouse9s 2023 tax return. See the discussion of tax return data in the <Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20)= question for a list of data elements that will transfer via the FA-DDX or be manually entered by the student spouse. Unlike the student, the student9s spouse will not be asked to report taxable college grants, scholarships, or AmeriCorps benefits. If the student or spouse had an amount to report, the student should have reported the joint total in the student section. The spouse will also not be asked about receipt of the earned income tax credit (EITC). Receipt of the EITC is used to determine if the student (or parent) is a single parent. If the student (or parent) is married, they are not a single parent, which makes it unnecessary to ask the spouse about the EITC. Student Spouse Consent, Approval, and Signature (29) Every student spouse contributor must provide the following for the student to be eligible for Title IV aid: Consent 3 The student spouse contributor must consent to the disclosure of certain identifying information to the IRS. Approval 3 The student spouse contributor must affirmatively approve that the U.S. Department of Education may receive, use, and redisclose to certain entities their federal tax information (FTI). Signature 3 The student spouse contributor9s FSA ID (username and password) will serve as their signature on the online FAFSA. Paper (PDF) FAFSA filers will provide a physical signature on their form. FAFSA Submission Married, independent students who did not file a 2023 tax return jointly with their current spouse now have a complete FAFSA ready for submission. The student will receive an email confirmation that the form was submitted. The spouse will see an abbreviated confirmation that the form is complete and that the student has been notified. Applicants who provide an email address will receive email notification when their form is processed with instructions to access their FAFSA Submission Summary. Students who do not provide an email address will receive a paper copy of their FAFSA Submission Summary. Contributor: Parent This section consists of 12 questions related to the parent of a dependent student. Dependent students will always have at least one parent contributor. If the student is completing the FAFSA form online, they will be prompted to enter their parent9s identity information (name, Social Security number, date of birth, and email address) to invite them to contribute to their FAFSA form. The parent will be notified by email that they have been invited to contribute to the student9s FAFSA form. The parent should use their own StudentAid.gov account username and password to access the student9s FAFSA form and complete their portion of the form. If the student9s parent is married and filed their 2023 taxes jointly with their current spouse, only one parent contributor is required. If the student9s parent is either (1) married or remarried, or (2) unmarried and living together, and did not file their 2023 taxes jointly with their current spouse or partner, the parent9s spouse or partner will be a required contributor on the student9s FAFSA form. If the student is completing the paper (PDF) FAFSA form, they will have their parent complete the parent section.', '<2-hop>\n\nWho Counts as a Parent on the FAFSA? In most cases, it9s clear who the parents are. A parent is a biological or adoptive parent, or a person that the state has determined to be a parent (for example, when a state allows another person9s name to be listed as a parent on a birth certificate). A stepparent is considered a parent if married to a biological or adoptive parent and if the student counts them in their family size. Biological and adoptive parents who are unmarried and living together select that as their marital status, and both report their information on the FAFSA form.']","The definition of a parent on the FAFSA is relevant to the completion of the form for students with unmarried biological parents living together because both parents must report their information on the FAFSA form. This is because the FAFSA considers both biological and adoptive parents who are unmarried and living together as parents, and they must select their marital status as such. This ensures that the financial information of both parents is included in the assessment of the student's eligibility for financial aid.",multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer
"How does the FAFSA form address situations where a student's parent has a unique tax filing status, such as not filing a U.S. tax return due to foreign income or other reasons?","['<1-hop>\n\nParent Tax Filing Status (37) This question asks if the parent filed (or will file) a 2023 IRS 1040 or 1040-NR. If the answer is <no=, the parent will be asked to select one of the following reasons for not filing: 1. The parent filed or will file a tax return with Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory. 2. The parent filed or will file a foreign tax return. 3. The parent either earned income in a foreign country but did not and will not file a foreign tax return, or worked for an international organization and was not required to report income on any tax return. 4. The parent, even though they earned income in the U.S., did not and will not file a U.S. tax return because their income was below the filing threshold. 5. The parent did not and will not file a U.S. tax return for reasons other than low income. 6. The parent did not and will not file any tax return because they did not earn any income or they were not required to file under the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these questions is to determine if a parent was either (1) required to file a 2023 U.S. federal tax return and did not or (2) has income from a foreign country that must be manually entered on the FAFSA form. A dependent student will be automatically eligible for a Maximum Pell Grant if their parent (and parent9s spouse or partner) is subject to the U.S. Tax Code but is not required to file a 2023 U.S. federal tax return. The student will be assigned an SAI of -1,500 and will not be required to provide any further financial information on the FAFSA form. Finally, married parents are asked if they filed their 2023 tax return with their current spouse. Individuals who were married and filed jointly with the IRS and are no longer married to the spouse on the applicable tax return, or who have married a different spouse, will be required to manually enter their income and tax information. See the <Joint Return Filers Who Are No Longer Married= section in Chapter 4 for additional information on separating tax return and income information. Individuals who only file foreign tax returns will also be unable to use the FA-DDX since it does not link to foreign tax authorities. They will instead need to manually input their income and tax data by converting foreign currency to U.S. dollars and entering the resulting amounts in the comparable fields from U.S. tax returns. See the <Student Tax Filing Status (19)= question for additional information. If the parent indicates they earned income in a foreign country but did not file a foreign tax return, or worked for an international organization, such as the United Nations, World Bank, or International Monetary Fund (option 3), they will need to manually input their income and tax data, similar to individuals who file foreign tax returns. See <Non-tax filers, foreign countries, and international organizations= under <', '<2-hop>\n\nStudent Tax Filing Status (19)= for additional guidance. If a parent indicates they did not file a U.S. tax return for reasons other than low income (option 5), you should treat this as conflicting information and request documentation to resolve it, which may include requiring the individual to file a tax return and present sufficient documentation of filing to you. If a parent indicates they did not file any tax return because they did not earn any income (option 6) and their state of legal residence is a foreign country, you must determine if the parent has foreign untaxed income that, when included in the SAI calculation, impacts a student9s Pell Grant eligibility. Comment code 303 on the student9s ISIR should prompt you to request additional documentation. If your inquiry into the parents9 financial situation shows that the student might be eligible for less or no Pell grant funds, you may use PJ to account for the parents9 untaxed income and assets, similar to the action you might take when there is a substantial foreign earned income exclusion on a U.S. tax return that can affect a student9s Pell eligibility.

Fiscal Year Tax Returns For a fiscal year (rather than calendar year) tax return, the individual should use information from the return that includes the greater length of time in 2023. For example, an individual who files a fiscal year tax return that begins in September would have two tax returns that overlap the 2023 calendar year 3 September 1, 2022, thru August 31, 2023, (FY23) and September 1, 2023, thru August 31, 2024, (FY24). Since the FY23 tax return covers 8 months of the 2023 calendar year and the FY24 tax return covers 4 months of the 2023 calendar year, the individual should use the FY23 tax return that begins on September 1, 2022, to complete the FAFSA form. Note: There are more days in the year between July 1 and December 31 (184 days) than between January 1 and June 30 (181, or 182 in a leap year). Keep that in mind when determining the length of time attributed to a fiscal year tax return that begins on July 1. Student 2023 Tax Return Information (20) For U.S. tax filers, much of the information in Question 20 will be transferred directly from the IRS via the FA-DDX.

Any taxable portion should be included in this field. Foreign earned income exclusion. From IRS Form 1040 Schedule 1: line 8d. This amount is typically a negative value on the tax return. The SAI formula will consider the absolute value of any negative value reported. Annual Child Support Received (21) Annual child support received is included as an asset of the recipient in the SAI formula. If an independent student (and their spouse, if married) received child support in the last complete calendar year, they should enter the total amount received for all children in the family size in this question. Student Assets (22) An asset is property that the family owns and has an exchange value. The FAFSA form collects current data (as of the day the FAFSA form is signed) about cash, savings and checking accounts; investments and real estate; and businesses and investment farms. Most assets are investments such as qualified education benefits or savings accounts, Coverdell education savings accounts, real estate, installment and land sale contracts (including mortgages held), trust funds, mutual funds, money market funds, Uniform Gifts and Uniform Transfers to Minors (UGMA and UTMA) accounts, certificates of deposit, stocks, stock options, bonds, commodities, and precious metals. If the asset isn9t a business or farm, it is reported as an investment. The FAFSA form asks for the net worth of investments, which is their total current market value minus their associated debts. If their net worth is negative, zero should be reported. Applicants will be asked to report the net worth of all businesses and farms, regardless of the size of the enterprise, location of the family9s residence on the property, or number of employees. The current net worth (the current market value minus the debt owed on it) is reported for land, buildings, machinery, equipment, livestock, unharvested crops, and inventories. However, the value of a family9s primary residence is still excluded, even if the residence is on the farm property or used to run the business. Applicants should determine the total net value of all farm assets and subtract the net value of their principal residence to determine the final value of their farm assets. The principal residence may include the family9s home, as well as structures and land adjacent to the home that are not being used, stored, or sold for farming or other commercial activities. Property values are generally assessed at a rate that considers the use of the property and the value of the land. Applicants and their families may refer to their property tax assessments from municipal, county, or state governments to help determine and separate the value of their principal residence from other property.']","A student should report only the amount of grants and scholarships received that was reported as taxable income on their tax return.

"How does the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) streamline the FAFSA application process by utilizing the Internal Revenue Service, and what role does the Internal Revenue Code play in this process?","['<1-hop>\n\nVerification Following Disasters The Dear Colleague Letter GEN-17-08 gives general guidance for awarding aid in federally declared disasters. It states that the Secretary will not enforce the verification requirements during the award year for applicants whose records were lost or destroyed because of a disaster if the school has tried to preserve and reconstruct any records. The school must document when it does not perform verification for this reason and use status code <S= when reporting the disbursement of Pell Grants to affected students. Also, the requirement for dependent students to submit a statement signed by a parent regarding family size is waived if the parents cannot provide the signature due to the disaster. The school must note why no parent was able to provide the statement. Schools that experience a local disaster (rather than a federally declared one) that affects Title IV administration should consult their regional school participation division. Acceptable Documentation The FAFSA Simplification Act requires that, wherever possible, the Department use data received directly from the IRS to calculate a student9s SAI and Pell Grant award. The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act (FUTURE Act) requires the Department of Education to access tax information held by the IRS pertaining to FAFSA applicants4and, where applicable, their parents and spouses4through a secure method: the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX). The FUTURE Act amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to mandate the disclosure of FTI directly from the IRS to the Department with an individual9s consent and approval. The FUTURE Act also made providing consent and approval for the exchange of FTI a requirement for receiving federal student aid. Applicants and contributors will be required to provide consent and approval to retrieve FTI directly from the IRS. When FTI is received from the IRS via the FA-DDX, the FTI received is considered verified and no additional documentation is necessary. As a result, the FA-DDX is the fastest, easiest, and most secure method of meeting income and tax verification requirements. The September 4, 2024 Federal Register Notice gives the documentation required for verifying 2025-26 application data, which depends on the item verified, as explained in this section. If you use a verification document, be sure that it is signed, that all required sections are completed, and that any relevant tax or alternative documents are attached. Copies of original documents are acceptable. An original signature on an original document, an original signature on a copy of a document, and a copy of a document with an original signature on it are all valid signatures, unless specifically noted in this chapter. If a copy of the tax return is used, the filer (or at least one of the filers of a joint return) must sign it or the tax preparer must provide their name and SSN, EIN, or PTIN. Suggested Verification Text The Department has developed suggested text that you may use to create a verification document and to verify non-tax items, such as family size. To review the suggested text for 2025-26, please see Dear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10. The suggested text fulfills verification requirements, but schools do not have to use it, except as noted below. Instead, they may develop and use their own (or someone else9s) text, forms, documents, statements, and certifications that are specific to the items required to be verified for a particular student or group of students at the school. However, schools they tried to locate their estranged spouse. The school determines that the student doesn9t need to verify their spouse9s tax and income information. However, the student must still verify their own information. The school may also choose to use professional judgment to remove the spouse9s information from the student9s FAFSA form.', '<2-hop>\n\nApplication and Verification Guide Introduction This guide is intended for college financial aid administrators and counselors who help students with the financial aid process4completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, verifying information, and making corrections and other changes to the information reported on the FAFSA form. Throughout the Federal Student Aid Handbook, we use <college,= <school,= and <institution= interchangeably unless a more specific use is given. Similarly, <student,= <applicant,= and <aid recipient= are synonyms. <Parents= in this volume refers to the legal parents of dependent students, and <you= refers to the primary audience of the Handbook: financial aid administrators at colleges. <We= indicates the U.S. Department of Education (the Department, ED), and <federal student aid= and <Title IV aid= are synonymous terms for the financial aid offered by the Department. We appreciate any comments that you have on the Application and Verification Guide (AVG), as well as all the volumes of the FSA Handbook. We revise the text based on questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please reach out to us about how to improve the FSA Handbook through the <Contact Customer Support= feature in our Partner Connect Help Center clicking on <FSA Handbook= under the Topic section. FAFSA Simplification Act The FAFSA Simplification Act, passed on Dec. 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, mandated a significant overhaul of federal student aid, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form, need analysis, and many policies and procedures for schools that participate in the Title IV programs. FSA implemented the FAFSA Simplification Act alongside the FAFSA portion of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act to streamline the FAFSA application process. Changes From the FUTURE Act The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct data exchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate completing the FAFSA form. The previous tool to transfer U.S. income and tax information from the IRS 3 the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was retired after the close of the 2023-24 application cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX eliminated the need for most applicants (and their spouse or parents) to self-report their income and tax information reported to the IRS. Also, federal tax information (FTI) that is transferred via the FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered verified for Title IV purposes. Unlike with the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student9s spouse and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide consent and approval for the Department to obtain FTI from the IRS via the FA-DDX and use it to determine the student9s eligibility for federal student aid. Other Changes Throughout the AVG, all dates, pertinent tax return and schedule information, along with various resources and references have been updated to support the requirements associated with the 2025-26 processing year and the 2023 base tax year. Where appropriate, links and publications associated with FSA9s Partner Connect and Knowledge Center have been properly updated. We also removed references to COVID-19 guidance and waivers. Some sections were moved to better align topics and assist with narrative flow. Use the search feature to find sections that may have been relocated. The following describes changes made in each chapter.']","The FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) streamlines the FAFSA application process by allowing the Department of Education to access tax information directly from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with the consent and approval of the applicants and their contributors.
