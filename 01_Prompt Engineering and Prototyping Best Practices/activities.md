## ‚ùì Discussion Question #1

**Prompt**:  
What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

**Answer**:  
Here is a definition of 'vibe checking' from AI Makerspace: 
'Vibe checking' is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

One of the biggest limitations of vibe checking is from its informal and unstructured nature. As an evaluation tool, additional weaknesses include:
- subjectivity
- lack of reproducibility
- no quantitative metrics
- surface-level coverage
